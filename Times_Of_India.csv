""there are no ingredients of a calling attention motion in this case,"" he said. unmindful of the ruckus by congress members, mehta continued to rap the opposition for raising the issue for the sake of publicity and sought a ruling from the speaker. amidst heated arguments, mehta told the house that the patient was not given hiv-infected blood, and that there was no question of negligence and punitive action against any officials. mehta said the patient's father was given three bottles of blood by a blood bank in jamnagar, which had collected it from a donation camp jointly organised by guru govindsingh hospital and j h hathi memorial blood bank. of these, one bottle which contained hiv-positive blood was immediately destroyed, while the blood from two bottles was given to the patient.

"Seema Kamdar,Aug 15, 2001, 01:23 IST",Three-in-one drug for HIV receives mixed reaction,"mumbai: the launch of a capsule, a combination of three anti-retroviral drugs, gives hiv patients reason to cheer. specialists on hiv hail it as heralding a ``compact world order"". though the capsule is a welcome relief to hiv patients, its welcome is laced with lots of caution. the good news first. the capsule, triomune, reduces the `pill burden' of hiv patients. they don't have to live with too many pills and schedules, says dr shashank joshi, a consultant with lilavati hospital. ``for sheer convenience and compliance, fixed dose combinations will be the order of the day,"" he says. the cost factor is gratifying (at about rs 1,800, i.e. less than $ 40), says a spokesperson of the people's health organisation, given that an international equivalent of this drug is available for $800 in the grey market. the centre's decision to exempt all hiv/aids drugs from customs and excise duties will bring the cost of triomune further down to rs 1,500, he says. launched by an indian pharmaceutical company last week, triomune combines three anti-retroviral drugs: lamivudine, stavudine and nevirapine. anti-retroviral drugs are reported to boost the immunological system of an hiv patient and prevent the virus from multiplying or infecting new cells, thus bringing down the viral load. apart from bringing hiv drugs within the reach of more hiv-affected people, the price reduction will also encourage many to keep away from quacks and dubious medicines, doctors say. while bringing down treatment costs of hiv infection, doctors are also wary of this instant, pop-easy culture that this drug signals. the medical community nurses some apprehension about its possible misuse by ``enterprising"" doctors who may be emboldened to recommend this drug freely to patients since it makes prescription so much simpler. drug intake should be monitored and be given under ``careful medical supervision"", dr joshi points out. otherwise, there is a very real risk of the drug getting misused, thanks to the way it has simplified medication. in the absence of a special branch dealing with hiv infection and treatment, the possibility of the drug being mis-prescribed or over-prescribed cannot be ruled out, he says. ``usually, doctors do not like to lose their patients and end up scribbling down some medicines even in hiv cases though they may not be trained. with the capsule, they do not even need to be informed,"" says an aids specialist who does not wish to be named. ``triomune rids doctors of the anxiety of determining the precise dosage of three different drugs,"" a doctor says. the capsule culture can work in the u.s. where patient compliance is monitored by giving them simulated drugs for the first two weeks and professional counselling is the norm, says an expert. ``here, there is no such thing as patient counselling or monitoring,"" another expert says. moreover, doctors fear that the low cost would also tempt one to self-medicate, apart from falling prey to doctors untrained in hiv care. the cost of treatment is anyway one component in hiv care. ``hiv cases require extensive monitoring. every three months, the viral load and cd4 count has to be tested. these two tests alone cost rs 4,000. if the drug is taking effect, the viral load will drop and the cd4 count will go up. however, after a while, the patient may develop drug resistance and record reverse results. in that case, he should be administered new drugs along with the ant-retroviral regimen. this pushes up costs considerably,"" an hiv counsellor says. ``very often, doctors recommend drugs to hiv patients even without these two basic tests when these tests are an absolute must,"" she points out. this could have serious repercussions since anti-retroviral drugs can have a few side-effects like nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, peripheral neuritis, itching, rash and even high liver toxicity. informed prescription is a must in a country where the patients, too, are, by and large, poorly informed about health matters. doctors fear that with cheaper drugs, patients may not want to go through tests which are costlier than a month's treatment. as it is, patients are reluctant to shell out the huge sums for tests. far from boosting immunity, this would create havoc with a patient's system. ``if random use of anti-retroviral drugs is encouraged, users may develop multi-drug resistance because of its liberal use as happened with tb, says dr joshi. price wars are no doubt good for the patient, but only when coupled with trained counselling. given the appalling ignorance on hiv even among the medical community and the fact that aids remains a grey area for medical practice, as there is no clear understanding as to who can and cannot treat the disease, the need for more training programmes for medicos cannot be over-stated, doctors say. ``we need rigorous continuing medical education (cme) programmes for all doctors so that they are better aware of the pitfalls of all kinds of drugs,"" adds an expert.

"Kalpana Jain,Sep 9, 2001, 22:24 IST",An epidemic of missing HIV patients,"new delhi: at a missionary-run hospital in patna, dr ravi sahay has of late started getting a steady trickle of hiv affected patients. but instead of treating them, he turns them away for fear of contracting the virus. and he believes other doctors need to be warned as well. so, he refers these patients to a government-run set up, announcing their hiv positive status in red ink. the patients are never seen again. their records never show up in government hospitals or even in the annual surveillance figures handed out by the national aids control organisation for the past three years on the basis of the reports collected from states. but these patients do appear as cold statistics in the records of private testing centers. just one centre in patna, sen diagnostics, has 615 confirmed cases. but these are not even considered by the government. officially, bihar remains a low prevalence state, with only 44 reported cases. clearly the annual government count, which shows a gradual slowing down of the rate of infection over three years - from 3.5 million in 1998 to 3.86 in 2000 - is not measuring the epidemic accurately. even if bihar's example were to be attributed to inefficient overall governance, serious gaps remain in the annual surveillance exercise even in states with a strong administration. project director of the national aids control organisation, jvr prasada rao, admits there are problems. ""pinpointed data from surveillance is not reliable. but over a period of time a trend is discernible. you have to have validation exercises by taking actual observations from a community nearby."" so states are still trying to come up with an efficient system, even as surveillance, conducted over a three-month period, from august 1 to october 31, at 232 designated sites all over the country, forms the basis of future policy. as of now, sample collection remains faulty even at the best of centres. dr v. lakhshmi, at nizam's institute of medical sciences, hyderabad, who is also a regional coordinator for surveillance, agrees that some centres may not be able to collect the requisite number of samples. for instance, victoria hospital in bangalore could get only half the requisite number of std cases last year. there are other problems as well: in kerala, there were no kits for testing at some centres, even after the blood had been collected. these samples then had to be thrown away. in manipur, transportation of samples to testing sites is not easy. moreover, sample vials are not always properly sealed and their contents are known to spill. at several centres in bihar, sample collection is barely a tenth of what is required. even the capital city of patna collected only 46 samples from pregnant women against the stipulated 400. districts such as darbhanga sent only 33 samples from std patients, when the required number was 250. an important statement by the union health minister recently that the epidemic has plateaued off is based on such surveillance.

" By Siddhartha D. Kashyap,Dec 2, 2001, 01:14 IST",No guidelines for treatment of HIV-infected women,"pune: despite all the money and attention lavished on aids 'awareness' and control programmes, there is no standard guideline for treatment of pregnant women infected with hiv. this, despite the fact that pune,along with mumbai and sangli have, together, the highest number of hiv-infected pregnancies in the country. doctors are thus awaiting results of a feasibility study being conducted at the national aids control organisation (naco) on how to reduce the chances of viral transmission from the infected mother to her baby. findings of the study, conducted at 11 centres across the country, including the sassoon hospital here and two centres in mumbai, are expected to be out soon. the study is examining the effects of a prescribed anti-retro viral drug on infected women.while most city hospitals prescribe zidoviudin or nevirapine, some others, for instance the armed forces medical college, administer lamivudin to hiv-infected pregnant women. naco, which earlier recommended zidoviudin for hiv-infected pregnant woman, later switched to nevirapine, which was cheaper. ratna yashwante of nari said zidoviudin used to be given twice a day for a month from the beginning of the 36th week of pregnancy.the total cost of this therapy proved to be too costly for patients in the low income group as a single tablet costs rs 60, she said. nevirapine, on the other hand, is given only once, at the onset of labour pains. aids specialist dr sanjay pujari, who is equally anxious about the findings of the study, said there is utter confusion amongst doctors, particularly in government-run hospitals about the correct treatment since there are no standard guidelines. some countries have made it mandatory for doctors to administer a common anti-retroval drug to patients, he said. the prevalence of hiv infection among pregnant women in the city has crossed two per cent, he says, due mainly to lack of screening and diagnostic facilities for pregnant women, compounded by poor access to retro-viral drugs and breast milk substitutes. it makes matters worse when there is no standard procedure laid down for handling mother-to-child transmission. dr kapila bharucha, head of the obstetrics and gynaecology department, sassoon hospital, also calls for a common set of guidelines in the present context of mother-tochild transmission of the killer virus, which has assumed dangerous proportions. dr sanjay mehendale, deputy director, nari, said studies have been recently carried out in thailand and abidjan (africa) by adminstering doses of zidoviudin, and it showed 50 and 37 per cent reduction in the rate of transmission respectively from the infected mother to the child. another study with nevirapine was conducted at uganda where the risk of transmitting the disease from the mother to baby was reduced by 47 per cent. he said the rate of paediatric hiv infection in india, along with some african nations, is as high as 15-20 per cent, compared to two per cent in the developed countries.

"Kalpana Jain,Dec 1, 2001, 01:43 IST","In India, drug price tip of HIV iceberg","new delhi: when krishna rao went to a hospital in visakhapatnam with symptoms of hiv, the doctor handed him a prescription for three medicines, one of which was an anti-retroviral drug. the total cost of medicines for a month was rs 1,943. krishna rao, who earns rs 2,000 a month as a farm labourer, sold his belongings to buy the medicines, believing they would cure him. little did he realise that taking the drug for a month and stopping abruptly would only increase his problems. he also did not know that a combination of anti-retrovirals needs to be taken to allow the drugs to prolong life. even as a concerted campaign is launched on world aids day on saturday for affordable drugs, ensuring proper therapy still remains way down on the list of health priorities. a majority of the 3.9 million living with the virus in india continue to die early of hiv not only because anti-retrovirals are unaffordable but also because health professionals are not adequately trained, wrong combinations of drugs are prescribed, and monitoring of these highly toxic drugs is inadequate. as a result, hiv at 20 may have become a manageable, chronic disease with the help of these drugs, but only for those who also have access to a proper health infrastructure and effective monitoring system. as purnima madhivanan at yrg care points out: ''it seems to be common to give two drugs called azt and d4t together. they don't work if they are given together because of their antagonistic effects on each other. even an anaesthetist was on these drugs for a long time.'' as the therapy works by reducing the load of hiv in the body so that the damage to the immune system is minimised, the viral load needs to be checked from time to time. but while the therapy costs about rs 2,000 a month, a single test to determine the hiv load in the body costs rs 6,000. compliance to the complicated regimen of drugs is necessary to avoid drug resistance. president of the international aids society stefano vella has already stated that resistant strains have started emerging all over, including in mumbai and chennai, as a result of the indiscriminate use of the therapy.

"Siddhartha D.

""so far, we have examined 40 hivinfected pregnancy cases. none of the 19 babies was born with the virus,"" a source said, but adds that the babies are at risk of developing the virus till they are 18 months old. ""the babies are prone to the infection as long as they are breastfed,"" the source said. the project is aimed at studying infections at all the three stages: antinatal; during delivery; and after delivery when the child is breastfed. samples of placenta and breast milk of the infected mothers are being sent to the nari laboratory to study the pattern of the virus as well as the mode of transmission to the baby. dr madhuri thakkar from nari, who has undergone six months of specialised training under the french experts, will be testing the samples. several factors can influence maternal transmission of hiv in infants: an infection in the uterus, exposure to maternal blood or the presence of the virus in the mucosa of the birth canal during labour and delivery, and breast feeding are all possible infections routes. newborns who are part of the project take the confirmatory polymerase chain reaction (pcr) test to determine whether they have the virus, whereas the enzymelink immuno sorbent assay (elisa) test is conducted on infected mothers. in some cases, the women take a cd4/cd8 test which gives an exact clue to the mode of transmission and the lifespan of the infected person. all tests are administered free of cost at the nari laboratory as part of the project. dr ramesh s. paranjape, officer incharge, nari, said the project is aimed at understanding the virological or immunological factors that may influence mothertochild transmission. dr sanjay mehendale, deputy director at nari said considering the large numbers of mothertochild transmissions in the country, it is of utmost importance to explore the extent to which biomedical maternal factors like viral load, nutritional status, breast milk or placenta can influence the disease in newborns. dr raman gangakherkar, who heads the project, was unavailable to comment.

''sleep and food are the last things on our mind.when our first child died of bronchitis, we never thought he could be hiv-positive. the baby, who has not yet entered the world, is also doomed,'' he says breaking down. ''nobody thinks even for a single moment that they could be hiv positive,'' laments a doctor. the number of people proving hivpositive is on the rise. in 1998, 6,003 people were screened and 279 were found hiv positive. in 1999, although only 4,537 were screened, 326 were found positive, while in 2000, 4,620 were screened and 346 found positive. in 2001, 4,153 people had been screened till october 31 and 364 yielded positive results. the tragedy striking families is only becoming grimmer as the maximum number of people falling prey to the disease, primarily through sexual transmission, are in the most productive years of their lives, that is, 30 to 44 years of age.

""what is my fault?"" she asks in pain. and fear. she has no idea who she should turn to for help and whether her future is to lie shackled to a hospital bed. the plight of 25-year-old shevanti, wife of a truck driver, is no better. her husband died six months ago after contracting the disease. but not before transmitting it to her. she does not blame her husband, though, and faces her bleak future with fortitude though she has no support from friends and family and knows her life will probably end like her husband's did. vimal naidu, the second wife of a construction labour is looking after her husband who is in the last stages of aids at a hospital in pimpri. she is aware that her elder sister, the first wife of her husband, died of aids and she might too. ""what can i do, ab to sab uparwale ke haath me hain"" (it's now all in the hands of god). wives who are hiv-positive, having usually caught the virus from their husbands, suffer worse than men because though they invariably support their menfolk, there is no one to support or look after them. ""they are still at the receiving end,"" says dr suhas mate, pimpri chinchwad municipal corporation's (pcmc) aids control division in-charge. it is the worst sort of injustice, but in the industrial township of pimpri-chinchwad, with its migrant population, it is not uncommon. dr mate says 2.6 per cent of pregnant women coming to pcmc hospitals are hiv-positive. he admits this is ""a significant percentage"". the pcmc's talera hospital is the main aids treatment centre and has seen an increase in the number of patients in the last eight years. twenty-nine per cent of hiv/aids cases that come in are women, of which 26 per cent are housewives. traditional indian attitudes to men and marriage are responsible for this outrageous situation where women are the worst victims of a disease that was foisted on them - sometimes probably knowingly. in traditional indian society, a wife has little say in sexual activity. ""she cannot deny her husband sex even if she knows he is hiv-positive,"" dr mate says. then, the husband is often treated at a sophisticated private hospital while the wife is referred to a government hospital. ""the discrimination between men and women is highly visible even in such a pathetic situation,"" dr mate points out. while the woman invariably nurses her ailing husband, and his family usually rallies around, she gets no such care or sympathy, being ostracised by the family. dr mate says there is an urgent need to educate grown up girls and married women from the economically disadvantaged groups about hiv/aids. but it is society at large, and men in particular, who really need to be educated. the response of the authorities needs to be much more aggressive and procative than it is. for example, on december 1, which was observed as world aids day, the pcmc sponsored a poster and rangawali exhibition among college students. perhaps more useful was an essay competition for ninth and tenth standard students in which 500 students took part and many of them wrote about their own first-hand experiences of hiv/aids in their family environment. however to make a real difference in both the figures and the plight of women, a great deal more deeds to be done in practical terms. picture.. pcmc has organised a poster and rangawali exhibition on aids in kaladalan, at santa tuaram commercial complex, nigdi by pcmc. a rangawali creations are being made by rohini modak and roopali jitkar from abhinav kala vidyalya.

""we need drugs at no cost or at subsidised rates. hospitals don't have the necessary testing equipment,"" he added. the wining party or coalition has to move from its manifesto to real time management of aids and hiv. if the problem grows, tacking militancy would seem like a teddy bears picnic in comparison to the aids bomb.

""but we don''t like to discuss how we got the virus,"" says 30-year-old ujjwala. despite efforts to educate people about hiv/aids, it continues to be a stigma, especially for a woman, ujjwala says.

""my husband was a manager in a reputed company and yet the company harassed me before releasing his dues. even the insurance company dragged its feet when they came to know how my husband died,"" ujjwala adds. the situation worsened when her in-laws spread the word about her hiv status and it was only because of her parents'' support that she pulled herself out of depression. thirty-year-old neha''s story is equally poignant. ""i was working as a nurse in a reputed mumbai hospital and came to know about being hiv-positive when i miscarried. i was bleeding profusely, but the gynaecologist refused to even touch me. i was shifted to a municipal hospital, but had a similar experience there,"" she recalls. after her employers came to know of her hiv status she was promptly kicked out. ""it took me time to come to terms with the situation. my in-laws started humiliating me, the neighbours abused me and it was only my parents who stood by me,"" she told the times news network. now she has got enough courage to send her employers a legal notice for discriminating against her. shabana, 24, had to leave her husband''s house in 1998 when she tested hiv-positive.

Although doctors are attending to his ``opportunistic infections'''' (such as tuberculosis), the antiretroviral drugs meant mainly to tackle the HIV virus are not being given.,Reason: The state government is not subsidising the prohibitive cost of antiretroviral drugs which works out to Rs 2,000 per month.,Venkatesh is the tenth of the 12 HIV patients admitted to Bowring Hospital, who have been deprived of these due to the expense involved. Antiretroviral therapy for HIV infected people is known to transform this near fatal illness into a chronic, but stable one.,Bowring Hospital Medical Superintendent L. Chandramma told , that guidelines of the National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) the nodal agency for policy formulation and programme implementation stipulate issue of antiretroviral drugs to only two groups: pregnant mothers and those under post exposure prophylaxis (those who come in contact with a needle prick or with sputum or blood of HIV patients).,Chandramma, who is also the physician recognised by NACO for AIDS management in Karnataka, said her repeated petitions to the government for supply of free antiretroviral drugs to all HIV patients had been turned down on the ground that NACO guidelines do not permit this. ``It is depressing to see that out of 12 cases only two can avail the drugs. Antiretroviral drugs cannot cure AIDS, but like hypertension or diabetes, it can be kept under check,'''' she said.,Health and Family Welfare Minister A.B. Maalaka Raddy blamed the Centre for the situation. ``The Centre''s allocation of the drugs is a mere 0.9 per cent, when Sri Lanka''s is 9 per cent. The total turnover of pharmaceuticals manufactured in Karnataka is Rs 800 crore, but only Rs 70-80 crore can be purchased within the state,'''' he said.,Raddy said states depend on the Centre for devolution of funds. ``Funds are earmarked for TB and other diseases but AIDS has been neglected,'''' he added.,Karnataka along with Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Manipur has been bracketed in the `high incidence'' category. In fact, Congress President Sonia Gandhi expressed concern at Karnataka''s rating at the party CMs'' conclave in Guwahati recently. Aware of this scourge, Chief Minister S.M.

Yet if the men use condoms, they are infertile. But with sophisticated fertility methods, they hope, it should be possible to minimize the risk by separating sperm from the virus, which is in the seminal fluid.,Helping men with HIV have children is one of the last taboos for specialists, who now routinely offer services to patients with advanced cancer, gay men who use surrogate mothers, single women who pick sperm donors from catalogs and women well past menopause. ,In the competitive world of fertility centers, at least one clinic, at Columbia University, sees providing treatment to men with HIV as a way of helping unserved patients while gaining a market niche. It was at Columbia that Morrison and Corser eventually found help. ,The clinica™s director, Mark Sauer, said he knew he was taking risks. But he decided a few years ago that he could greatly reduce the chances of transmitting the virus by using a technique called intracytoplasmic sperm injection, injecting a single sperm into an egg.,Sauer said his clinic had treated 54 infected men. He has made more than 103 attempts at producing pregnancies. So far, 29 women have become pregnant and have had their babies or are more than halfway through pregnancy. Thirty babies have been born, with nearly half the women having twins, as is typical in fertility treatment. ,Sauer noted that published reports from Europe indicated that about 1,500 attempts at creating pregnancies with sperm from people with HIV, using a different method, had resulted in 250 successful pregnancies and no viral transmission. Sauer acknowledges that he has treated too few patients to judge the odds of infection. But he knows that many men with HIV want help in having children. (NYT News Service)"

The latter is also the chairman of the AIDS awareness programme in Karnataka.,The home accommodates 20 people and provides counselling and treatment free of cost. ``Since we had telephone counselling services for the last three years, more and more HIV patients were asking for a place to stay. Hence, we decided to open a small home for now and will later expand it,'''' Mathew said.,ACCEPT helps people to detect AIDS and then provides them with the support they need to overcome emotional and physical trauma.,Other activities include holistic care to patients and their families by providing medical and psychological relief, offering moral and value-based education to bring a behavioural change in their lives and conducting health awareness education to eliminate ignorance on HIV/AIDS."

A total of 88 VCTCs are functioning in the state at the area, district and teaching hospitals. However, the problem that STD clinic doctors often face is that though they were treating patients who are potential HIV carriers, they do not have a facility to test the patients immediately and have to refer them to the VCTCs functioning in the teaching hospitals.,This proved to be a problem as the VCTCs are located in the microbiology department of the teaching hospitals and hence there was no follow-up as to whether the patient went for the test at all. Moreover, the difficulty of locating the microbiology department in a teaching hospital deterred many patients from going for further tests. It was also noticed that many of the patients referred to the VCTCs never reported back with results and doctors were not able to keep track of the status of patients who came to the STD clinic, AP State Aids Control Society project director K Damayanti says.,It is also possible to give better care to patients once a HIV kit is available at the STD clinic as results can be obtained and suitable treatment administered to the patient immediately, the project director added. Though the problem does not exist in area and district hospitals, in teaching hospitals it is a major problem because of the sheer size of the hospital.,Incidentally, the state has the highest per cent of STD prevalence in the country with 7 per cent in males and females according to a National Aids Control Organisation study.

The so-called AIDS epidemic in Mumbai, it seems, is not following its predicted course.,aœOver 90 per cent of our patients are healthy, many for the past 10 to 12 years,a™a™ said Nagesh Shirgoppikar, a medical consultant at the Salvation Armya™s AIDS clinic in Mumbai. aœIf we can see them through the next three to five years, we will be able to show that even without the AIDS drugs (Anti Retro Viral Therapy), Indians who test HIV-positive and receive the right combination of care, can remain asymptomatic and do very well.a™a™,A group of 12 women, who had lost their husbands to AIDS, took time off from their tailoring class last week to share the secret of how they remain aœlong-term non-progressorsa™a™ as theya™re know by medical experts. ,Set up in 1995, Salvation Armya™s clinic regularly follows up on around 600 HIV-positive patients, providing them a range of services, including tailoring classes in an effort to make them economically independent.,The AIDS widows are candid about their husbands, who, they believe, passed on the virus to them. They believe it was not AIDS that led to their husbandsa™ early demise, but their addiction to alcohol, gutka or cigarettes coupled with a careless attitude to medication, and failing to adopt changes in their lifestyle. ,They extend this logic to their own situation. When they were declared as HIV-positive (through a single Eliza test), their vulnerability to infections such as cold, cough, fever, diorrhea and dizziness increased. They also suffered from weight loss. ,But the women believe that their physical vulnerability was more an outcome of their tension, fatigue after caring for their sick husbands and economic burden rather than AIDS-induced infections.,According to Lata, who was diagnosed HIV-positive 12 years ago, aœIt took us around two to four years to come to terms with our HIV status. We needed time to work out the anger we felt towards our husbands, the rejection of our families and to think quietly about how to deal with the fear.a™a™,Counselling gave her hope. She came across the Salavation Armya™s AIDS clinc where all her questions about AIDS were answered, and got access to good doctors whose detailed and regular check-ups caught infections early.,She also found a support group of sorts among women with similar afflictions. Thereafter, a aœpositive attitudea™a™ became the buzzword in their lives, she said. Lata and other women have learnt in the past decade that it is important to take care of their health. Sharda, another of this group, says that she does not eat out and carries her own drinking water whenever she goes. This has greatly helped in reducing bouts of diarrhoea, cold, cough and fever.,The group members are no longer careless about medication, and do not sit alone and mope at home. If they cannot find paid work, they volunteer for service to other AIDS patients.,aœWhat kills people is the lack of hope, tension, the absence of family and social support and our economic plight. With all other illnesses, even TB or cancer, everyone wants to help and support. HIV, this one word, makes everyone turn away.

This year round in association with city based NGO, Indu Health Research Foundation (IHRF), they have planned a special Garba for an HIV free society. The BITA-INDU Garba Mahotsav, this year, aims to raise funds for setting up a Voluntary Counselling and HIV Testing Centre (VCTC) in the city to provide free HIV testing and counselling to patients. ,aœWe received initial help from Dr Kiran Patel, an NRI doctor, to set up VCTC, which would provide free pre-HIV and post-HIV test counselling for any patient who comes to the centre. But to sustain the programme for all patients we needed funds, which we plan to collect through the BITA-INDU Garba Mahotsav,a� said Dr Vijay Shah. ,Former president of BITA, Dinesh Patel, said that they wanted to give the city traditional garbas and at the same time wanted to help the society, therefore they joined hands with IHRF. ,aœWe did not want our venture to be commercial. We thought of joining hands with IHRF after we were apprised of the plan of VCTC,a� added Patel,According to Shah, the HIV VCTC would start operations in November. City based psychiatrist Dr Sandeep Shah would head the counselling wing of the centre. Dr. Sandeep Shah said that he has approached the M S Universitya™s department of psychology students to volunteer their services for the centre. They would be trained and then would help in counselling the patients, who come for the HIV tests.,Commenting on the timings of the festival Patel said that the state government as yet had not fixed a deadline but if the limit was till 10 pm then they would abide by it. aœThis year we have made special security arrangements to avert an untoward incident. Though we plan to abide by the early deadline if imposed, I believe that there should be no deadline. ,If we have a deadline, then it would be a fulfilment of the wishes of the terrorists who attacked Akshardham.

He tested positive. ,The elite government-run primary health centre running in the area, close to Badalpur, Chief Minister Mayawati''s paternal village, did not have the basic screening kits. Following his death two months ago, his wife had to return to the same private laboratory. Again she paid Rs 350 for the test. ""It was better than travelling to Meerut and back in my state of health,"" she said.,But there have been other sufferers. On June 15 last year, Noida''s Sector 20 police arrested 20 alleged sex workers. A local court ordered that the women should be tested for HIV while in judicial custody. ,But since there were no testing kits in Noida''s state health facilities, the undertrials were kept in judicial custody for over two weeks. The women had to be sent to Meerut for the tests to be carried out and then wait for the results to arrive.,There are also instances of quacks running private pathology labs. ""In one case about three years ago,"" said an official, ""a former Ghaziabad laboratory technician started his own blood bank and laboratory. On receiving complaints, a medical team raided the facility.

It can be revealed to his or her family, but only after obtaining the HIV positive persona™s consent.,Legal experts are of the opinion that if the legislation is enacted, it will go against Article 19 of the Constitution, which guarantees an individual the right to privacy. It will also infringe on an individuala™s right to livelihood, provided by Article 21.,In most personal laws of marriage, registration is not required, hence a policy for mandatory testing is impossible to implement and will not prove to be beneficial in controlling the spread of the virus, say the legal experts. ,Moreover, similar initiatives around the world have failed even in countries where awareness about the virus is very high, such as the United States. ,The American Civil Liberties Union report of March 1998 stated that mandatory pre-marital HIV testing was a failure after such an initiative was not accepted by any of the states.

A decision to this effect was taken by the health department at the second meeting of the health promotion council.The meeting was presided over by health commissioner Ashok Kumar Chaudhary. The health department will issue a notification in this connection shortly. National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) chairman J S Verma, during his three-day visit to Patna in October last, had told the state government that the official figures for Aids and HIV positive cases did not reflect the real picture of the disease in the state. Verma had made this observation during his meeting with the top state government officials on October 23. Chief secretary S N Biswas, DGP R R Prasad, Chaudhary and the home commissioner were prominent among those attending the meeting. The official figure for confirmed cases of Aids has remained pegged at 133 in the state for the last six months though the number of HIV positive cases has increased to 1,700. Addressing a press conference on October 24, Verma said the lack of a sound health care system, particularly for mental cases, lack of facilities for the treatment of Aids/HIV positive cases and the trafficking in women and children too constitute violation of the human rights.,He asked the Bihar government to strengthen the health care system in the state. During his meeting with the state government officials, the NHRC chairman had expressed his serious concern over the social boycott of an Aids-affected family at Sahilarampur village in Muzaffarpur district.

The official, however, said that despite the government decision to declare Aids/HIV a notifiable disease, the confidentiality of such a patient would remain intact as only top officials of the health department and Bihar State Aids Control Society would be knowing about it.

The programme was launched at the Vani Vilas Hospital in Bangalore, a few months later. Rajamma asserted that the results were already showing with 60 per cent success rate.,The babies born under the programme are under observation for 18 months and after that period they are tested again for HIV status. So far, of the 19 babies born at the Vani Vilas Hospital, 12 were HIV negative, five were positive and two did not return for a follow up.,Rajamma said earlier that the profalaxis was done using multi-drug therapy ''AZT'' (anti-retro viral drug), which required intervention from the last four weeks of pregnancy. This, was cumbersome and many did not return for a follow-up.,A new drug ''Nevirapine'' has been introduced from October this year, where the intervention is only during labour. Rajamma said that this was an ultra short-term regimen where a single tablet (200 mg) was given to the patient in early part of labour and a single dose of suspension to the baby within 72 hours after birth.,This therapy will help in attending to emergency cases, which was not possible with AZT therapy, she said asserting that the National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) guidelines a"" that the patient should be informed about the therapy was strictly followed.,Prior to the intervention, the UNICEF used bondage issue to convince parents (if found HIV positive) to take drugs to save the new born from the disease. Rajamma maintained that it would help new borns to be healthy citizens as medical data suggested that 60 to 75 per cent of the transmission occurred during labour.,The incidence of transmission was only 10-15 per cent in the womb and 10-25 per cent after delivery.

Powrie said for many women, not having a baby and use of contraceptives was the right choice. ""But those women, who decide otherwise, should know that there are medications available to protect the child from the virus,"" he said. Powrie, who is also the member faculty of Wockhart-Harvard Medical Institute HIV/AIDS Education and Research Foundation (WHARF), said however, the multi-drug HAART is costly and not affordable to a vast majority of the people in India. ""However, short-term, single drug therapy is cheaper and has been shown to cut down transmission rate from 25 to 12 per cent,"" he added. Welcoming Maharashtra government's decision to screen pregnant women for HIV and make drugs available, Powrie said, ""the clinical claims have been validated by several studies in the US, Thailand and African countries and drugs are routinely used in Europe and the US among pregnant women"". Earlier speaking at another training programme for care givers in Sion Hospital, Powrie said breast feeding increased the risk of transmission of the virus from mother to child. He said the Indian experts concurred with their US counterparts that the benefits of providing nutrition through breast feeding overweighed the risk of transmission. ""Breast feeding among HIV positive mothers should be restricted to the first four to six months when the baby is able to take to solid foods,"" he cautioned. Acknowledging the fact that women were apprehensive in taking medicines during pregnancy, Powrie said, ""HIV positive mothers should take medications because of the baby's vulnerability"". Talking about women in US, he said, ""the challenge in US is how do we make sure every women gets tested for HIV."" "
"Dec 12, 2002, 00:18 IST",Homeopathy found useful for those with HIV,"NEW DELHI: Alternative systems of medicine are now seen to be helping those living with HIV. Arogya-2002, an exhibition on good health and living, inaugurated on Wednesday, showcases the results of trials conducted on people with HIV.While there is no cure as yet for the virus, the Central Council for Research in Homeopathy says that patients showed an improvement in their overall physical condition. The trials were conducted at three places a"" Delhi, Chennai and Mumbai.,All the patients selected for the trials were those who had not started showing any symptoms of the disease. During the trials, says the Central Council, it was observed that the number of CD4 cells a"" which control immune responses and decrease in people with HIV a"" showed a significant increase.,This also helped in delay of onset of infections as the immune system was strengthened. The Council also said that there was an improvement in all vital physiological functions of the patients.,Other than HIV, homeopathic drugs have been found to be helpful in several other diseases as well. Research work, on display at this exhibition, also shows how malaria, in its early stages, can be cured by this method of medicine. The Homeopathic Research Institute at Jaipur is currently doing more research on malaria.,Studies conducted at the Homeopathic Drug Research Institute, Lucknow, have shown the anti-diabetic action of homeopathic drugs. A drug, Cephalandra Indica, when tested on animals, found it could produce a significant fall in blood sugar.,Of course, like all other systems of medicine, this method too has its limitations and cannot be tried for every ailment, especially those requiring surgery. Certain diseases such as skin problems may respond well to the treatment.,To ensure that good quality homeopathic drugs are available, the government is working towards standardising them. Standards have already been fixed for 916 drugs out of a total of 2,100. There are about 1,500 homeopathic drugs that are of plant origin and about 600 that are extracted from natural chemicals produced by animals.,However, the availability of some of these plants may itself be difficult at times. Therefore, the department of Indian Systems of Medicine of the health ministry now cultivates its own exotic medicinal plants so as to drastically reduce the need to import them. A number of these plant varieties are found in the Nilgiri Hills. The department has set up a special research garden in Ooty for growing some of these plants. "

Many international organisations use a nationa™s infant mortality rate to gauge its developmental status.,Doctors said nationwide vaccination campaigns, the promotion of breast feeding and the use of oral rehydration solutions to combat diarrhoea had in the past few years been effective in checking most ailments of infants.

The exhibition has been brought to India by Apne Aap which seeks to end sex trafficking and Drik India, a network of photographers. According to some NGO activists, the media hound those affected with HIV/AIDS and try to rake up their past lives.,aœThese people are trying to lead as normal lives as possible and it is not fair to keep on interrogating them about how and why they contracted the disease,a� said a representative of Sanlaap, which has a rehabilitation home for trafficked and HIV-positive women.,The media were also said to be insensitive about revealing names of victims. aœEach media house should have a code of conduct, created at a common forum where there are representatives of NGOs, affected persons and the media. This should be adhered to,a� felt a member of Sparsha, a group working with positive people.,Social activist Shabnam Hashmi felt NGOs and other such organisations should encourage those affected to come out and spread awareness about the disease."

KSAPS, headed by chief minister S.M. Krishna, has found HIV prevalence high among young women in the state. Over 70 per cent of the women with HIV in care and support homes are housewives, abandoned and isolated by their families.,Low age of marriage (in rural areas), limited control over fertility, economic dependence coupled with illiteracy are some of the factors making women with HIV more vulnerable than her male counterpart, says the KSAPS surveillance report released last week.

There are so far 75 confirmed HIV cases reported at Bhavnagara™s Sir T Hospital, the only voluntary counselling and testing centre in the district. And, the agencies active in Alang-Sosiya yard have identified 38 HIV cases from Alang alone.,Dr Niloo Vaishnav, chairman of Bhavnagar blood bank, which runs Project Aids Alang (PAA) with the help of Gujarat State Aids Control Society (GSACS) says, aœThe incidence of HIV cases is very high in Alang. Of the 3,500 people who have come for voluntary blood testing in the last four years, nearly 38 of them have tested positive.a�,According to GSACS officials, the cases recorded with them are only those tested at government hospitals and the final figure could certainly be much higher.,Dr Vaishnav said on the basis of these statistics, a projection report carried out by an AIDS expert from New York-based Albert Einstein School of Medicine, showed that the prevalence of the infection could be as high as 5 per cent in Alang. This is perhaps the highest prevalence of HIV anywhere in Gujarat.,Alang has a population of around 40,000 male migrant labourers coming from Orissa, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal. Most of them leave their families behind to come here to earn a living. Also, almost all of them belong to the sexually active age group of 18-45 a"" around 39 per cent are between 18-25 years and 46 per cent belong to the 25-45 age bracket.,aœThe problem is compounded by the fact that there are very few women in the area. This makes the area even more trouble-prone as far as passing the infection is concerned,a� says Mahesh Jani, project officer of PAA.,According to him, besides a high occurrence of multiple partner sexual activity, unorganised prostitution and rampant homosexuality too are the important factors.,aœIt has been observed that sex workers from surrounding villages come here, many of them under the pretext of selling vegetables, fruits and other goods. But this is just a camouflage for their illegal activity,a� says Jani. According to a rough estimate, around 7.5 per cent people who have come for voluntary blood tests suffer from Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STD). The STDclinic in Alang gets around 50-55 patients every week.,According to Y P Deulkar, port officer, besides spreading awareness, the authorities should be given more teeth to curb prostitution. aœThe area supposed to be guarded is a huge 10 square miles, which is difficult with the existing number of hands,a� he says. The police station too does not have more than half-a-dozen personnel.,However, officials of the GSACS maintain that use of force will only worsen the situation. aœThe situation could have been very bad without timely intervention of the concerned agencies. But at present, it is not alarming. The incidence of HIV positive cases surely is high in Alang, but the use of force will only destroy the rapport which we have created with the affected people and some sex workers over a period of time,a� says Dr D M Saxena, additional project director, GSACS.,The society is planning to start an a˜Enabling Environment Projecta™ in Alang along with 10 other centres. aœThe programme funded by United Nations Development Programme aims at helping the affected,a� says R B Deshmukh, project director, GSACS."

Gujarat, being an industrially-developed state, is highly vulnerable to AIDS owing to its floating population, mostly comprising of migrant labourers, said Dr Yogesh Marfatia, a skin specialist, during a training programme for doctors organised by the People's Training and Research Centre. The alarming number of HIV cases is an indication that only a negligible portion of the population in the city practices safe sex, he said. Unless we control sexuallytransmitted diseases, we can't contain the spread of HIV, Marfatia said, adding that a decade ago, the city did not have even a single case of HIV. PTRC, a voluntary organisation, is working towards prevention of HIV among industrial workers in the city. PTRC workers have so far mapped about 10,000 workers in the industrial belt of Makarpura. Industrial workers are among the high risk groups for HIV like truck drivers, commercial sex workers, migrants, etc. We have identified about 15 slum pockets in the Makarapura area, where we conduct awareness and health camps, said Suresh Parmar, a project officer. Training of medical professionals from all streams — be it ayurveda, homoeopathy or allopathy — we are providing a wider choice to industry workers for whom treatment is never affordable. The latest strategy is to have a single approach to tackle all endemic diseases, including the sexually-transmitted diseases (STDs), said PTRC director Jagdish Patel. "

"May 24, 2003, 03:04 IST",Gates Foundation aid will target high-risk HIV groups ,"NEW DELHI: The 100 million dollar Gates Foundation grant to reduce HIV transmission in India will be primarily used to address high-risk groups in the 100 `high prevalence' districts. The disbursal of the money will begin from July. Laying down a road map for an effective utilisation of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation assistance, director, India AIDS Initiative, Ashok Alexander, told Times News Network that the Foundation has worked on a programme of action that is scaled, focussed and integrated and could well present a new model on prevention. The Foundation would work with a district focus as also have a national highway programme. To begin with, it has identified two partners -- the Indian Oil Corporation and the Trucking Corporation of India. Alexander said the IOC, with 2,000 retail outlets on highways would provide the points for communication as well as treatment for sexually transmitted infections. The Trucking Corporation of India, again with a tremendous reach all over India, would provide 50 to 75 halting points for trucks where interventions could be reached. The Foundation would help set up mobile clinics for treatment of STI and also create a national STI franchise whereby quacks could be encouraged to refer people to MBBS doctors. Alexander said while the AIDS virus may have moved into the general population, there was still a need to focus on the high risk groups, such as commercial sex workers, intravenous drug users, truck drivers and other identifiable clients of sex workers. He said the high-risk groups had still not been sufficiently covered. As for not going to states where the infection rates are still not known to be high, Alexander said, ``we're not leaving them out. We're just deferring them by six months or so. We need to have some research on these states so as to have intelligence on how to approach them.'' Alexander said the epidemic in India is still localised with about 100 odd districts which account for about 70 per cent of the infection. The populations most at risk are identiable and so are the national highways around which the infection rates are high. And even as the Foundation has yet to decide on most of its partners, Alexander said, the funds would be monitored very closely. ``We will bring sound private sector nations and termination of contracts where partners are found not performing.'' As for monitoring, a third party, ``highly credible'' will be engaged. The aim eventually is to create a programme based on Indian ownership and an Indian face. Alexander said the Foundation hoped that the Indian corporates and Indian NGOs would take this programme forward. A special focus in this intiative, therefore, would be to include ``Indians for India'' where ``high-potential'' graduates with an interest in HIV and development would be encouraged to take up work.

"Amarendra Jha,May 22, 2003, 22:23 IST",High percentage of Sura's sex workers have HIV,"SURAT: Around 43.2 per cent of sex workers were found to have sero-prevalence of HIV or were HIV positive, according to a recent study. The findings were on the basis of a cross sectional study among sex workers in a health camp over a period in the year 2000. The study was conducted by the department of community medicine, Government Medical College in Surat, under a project sponsored by Department for International Development (DFID) of the UK. Though the HIV tests were done secretly through administration of behavioural questionnaire followed by clinical examination of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), laboratory tests were conducted over a period of time from February 2000 to September 2000 after obtaining the consent of the participants, report said. Out of 600 sex workers in the red-light area, 124 in the age group of 16 to 50 — with about two-thirds being below 30 — opted for clinical tests, the report revealed. Notably, among the sex workers in the red-light area here, three were locals, over 33 per cent were reported to be from Nepal and the rest had migrated from other states, the report said. In all, over 80 per cent were illiterate, and about 95 per cent reported to use condoms during sex. The range in the number of different partners per day varied from two to 25, the mean being five clients per day in each case, according to the report. Since sex workers being one of the core groups for transmission of STDs (sexually transmitted diseases) and HIV as a 'bridge group' to the general population, a comprehensive intervention is being focussed on, said Dr Vikas Desai of department of community medicine in the Government Medical College here. ""We had some data base on a survey done in 1992 which has been effective as a baseline for the prevention of STDs and HIV among sex workers,"" she forwarded. HIV cases have been on increase here, but source of transmission by the sex workers or by the clients need to be examined thoroughly for a comprehensive intervention, she said. For the purpose of creating awareness, 17 peer educators and about 34 link workers have been working among the sex workers. Even through social marketing for distribution of condoms have been intensified, but due to lack of adequate trained manpower along with proper financial resources, the intervention for the targeted group is yet not up to the mark, she said. Though the report was based on the targeted group of sex workers in the redlight area here, but no such surveys have been conducted in the case of over an estimated 5,000 sex workers operating from different parts of the city, Desai said. Many of them, in fact, come from Mumbai on regular basis, she said. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has emphasised on a syndromic approach for case measurement and management, particularly in high prevalence areas with inadequate resources for surveys, according to Dr H Thakore who works for WHO and had been associated with this report. For continuation of prevention among the HIV positive cases, a similar one-year project has been sponsored by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), Thakore informed. Interestingly, one wellequipped voluntary counselling and testing centre (VCTC) at the New Civil Hospital here is functional since January, 2000, but even services being free-ofcost, hardly anyone other than those referral cases, come here, Desai said. Even toll free number 1097 for free tele-counselling at the hospital has been without much of use, she informed. "

The BSACS official said that these centres were very important from the point of view of prevention of HIV infection and providing care and support to those already infected.,The BSACS official said that the high cost of up to Rs 300 charged for the HIV test at private clinics and lack of counselling services discouraged people from going in for testing. The official said that at the VCTCs, this test was being conducted at Rs 10 each only while counselling was provided free of cost and people were encouraged to opt for the test voluntarily."

Although the infected blood is discarded, blood banks stop short of doing the next important thing a"" telling the donor his/her HIV status. ,When this could well prevent the spread of the virus,what stops the blood banks from informing such HIV-positive donors? Blood bank sources cite ""practical and technical reasons"". ,First, they want to avoid running into legal problems by disclosing such sensitive information. Second, they do not have the counselling facilities. ,Says a blood bank source, ""We cannot inform without confirming the HIV status of the donor. The test carried out in our lab is only a screening test and not a diagnostic one. It requires repeated tests, using other kits, to confirm the same, which we don''t do here."" ,A doctor at a blood bank who declined concern is to decontaminate and store blood. How can we follow up on every HIV-positive donor?"" A blood bank in-charge says that informing a donor of his HIV status can be tricky. ,""A letter from a blood bank can be disturbing for the donor, especially if his/her family members or acquaintances learn about it. There have been cases before of people committing suicide after learning that they were infected. It could land us in legal problems if something happens to the donor,"" he says. ,Blood bank officials say that the best they can do is to inform the donor if he/she asks for the test results and then send him to a government voluntary counselling centre. Most blood banks, however, do not have trained counsellors. ,Some blood bank managers say such cases are too few to deserve appointing a counsellor. Significantly, the National Blood Policy, under the national AIDS Control Programme allows disclosure of the HIV status of a person if pre-test and posttest counselling could be made available."

Of an estimated 4.5 million HIV-positive cases in India, 2 lakh are estimated to be children. ,Health activists believe that while the total annual health ministry budget is Rs 225 crore, the new policy alone could cost about Rs 600 crore annually. Says Amar Jesani, founder of the Centre for Enquiry into Health and Allied Themes (CEHAT), aœIt is inconsistent to have a health policy where you cana™t get free treatment for a cold at a public health centre because it lacks basic drugs, but can get free antiretroviral treatment for HIV. ,If the government is ready to provide universal health care, it must cover all diseases, including AIDS. But if it is selective, it raises doubts as to its motivations. One wonders if the interests of pharmaceutical companies was a considerationa�.,For other doctors, the lack of infrastructure to administer such a policy is of greater concern. Says Sanjay Pujari, director of the Department of HIV Medicine, Ruby Hall Clinic, Pune, aœThe infrastructure required for safe and effective delivery of health care for paediatric patients is not yet in place.,We need physicians trained in paediatric HIV care and regular monitoring and testing of response to treatment. All these will cost much more than the drugs.,They have become more cheaper now, so there is not much of a profit margin for pharmaceutical companiesa�.,The singling out of children for free treatment is being seen as an irrational decision in public health circles. As Pujari points out, aœIt is not rational to exclude adults. ,Children with HIV usually have one or both parents with HIV, and if they are excluded from the therapy, who will look after the child? ,It makes more sense to treat families with HIV. Frankly, after the mother and child patients, it would be more cost-effective to prioritise adults who can be economically productive and on whom the family dependsa�.,Meanwhile, the policy can only be music to the ears of the pharmaceutical industry.

During subsequent visits (an average of three visits in 11 months), two of 191 men who were circumcised and 165 of 2,107 who were uncircumcised tested positive for HIV.,Demographics, sexual risk behaviour (including having sex with a prostitute), and condom use were remarkably similar between both groups, said Reynolds. Despite the similarity in risk profiles, researchers determined the incidence rate of HIV-1 among circumcised men it was 0.7 per cent, whereas among uncircumcised men it was 5.5 per cent, an eight-fold increase. ,However, the study did not find circumcision to be protective against other sexually transmitted diseases, including syphillis, genital herpes and gonorrhoea.,Circumcision was not totally protective and might not be culturally acceptable or safe in some settings, so regular condom use was still the best way of protecting against HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases, said Reynolds. ,Condom promotion remained a key strategy in the current fight against the spread of AIDS, he said.,""Circumcision as a potential prevention strategy requires confirmation by randomised clinical trials, which are the gold standard in evaluating medical interventions,"" he said. ,Three clinical trials are currently underway in Uganda, Kenya and South Africa.

They were humiliated in public and eventually kept under quarantine at the YFH in Mumbai by the SIA authorities for not possessing yellow fever vaccination certificates.,Pune-based Ruby Hall Clinic project AIDS director Dr Sanjay Pujari told TNN that it was wrong on the part of the airport authorities to seek to know the HIV positive status of the passengers. ,""I see no reason why the six HIV positive persons are under quarantine for yellow fever.

A major part of the funds is being utilised for infrastructure upgradation instead of developing and distributing vaccines,a� says Mumbai-based advocate Anand Grover, while addressing the national conference on AIDS held in Vadodara on Saturday.,Grover discussed the legal and ethical issues related to HIV and appealed to the medical fraternity to be sensitive to the needs of HIV patients.,aœA sea change in attitudes is necessary to tackle the issue. If qualified doctors practice strict confidentiality and dona™t discriminate, we can put an end to the quack menace,a� says Grover, who is the director of HIV/AIDS Unit of Lawyera™s Collective in Mumbai, which advocates a comprehensive law that could strengthen public health services.,Advocating a law that respects consent and confidentiality of individuals, protect people from discrimination based on HIV status, Grover said, aœWe seek to provide a safe haven to the marginalised sections of the society like homosexuals, drug addicts and commercial sex workers. This will encourage them to seek medical intervention.,Now, we are at loggerheads with law as distribution of fresh needles and condoms is banned.a�,A major social transformation is possible with legal modifications.,HIV is no more restricted to high-risk groups but has filtered down to the general population.,This has made amendments to the existing laws inevitable. Perhaps, a change of law regarding marital rapes, amendment to IPC Section 377 (which bans unnatural sexual behaviour), Immoral Trafficking Prevention Act and the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (prevention) Act, will create a congenial atmosphere for radical improvements in public health, feels Grover.,aœOur proposals are only peoplefriendly laws that are already implemented in the UK, Australia, Hong Kong, Philippines and US. They will only act as a catalyst to improve public health rather than attack our ethical values,a� says Grover, underlining the importance of safety of health care workers.,aœIncidence of HIV infection due to occupational exposure though negligible needs to be addressed. Every health care worker should be provided gloves, vaccines and safer working environment and equipped with knowledge and understanding of diseases.,An insurance cover will be a boon,a� says Grover.,Referring to the practice of subjecting all patients to HIV tests at private hospitals and making HIV test for employees compulsory at private companies, Grover says, aœThe law needs an immediate amendment as private sectors can still evade prosecution for discrimination on the basis of HIV status.a�,aœThis will glorify the stigma attached to the disease, thus crippling the HIV treatment services.,And HIV tests, prior to surgeries, are like a double-edged sword. If the patient tests positive, he might be deprived of the health services. But if he tests false negative, the doctor is at a great risk as he will falter on caution assuming it to be risk free,a� he added."

The figure further projects nearly one lakh people who are affected in Gujarat, with every third person amongst a thousand carrying the symptoms of the dreaded disease.,A major cause for the high prevalence of the disease, the survey estimates is lack of awareness amongst the high risk migrant population. It is with this purpose that the Vatsayan counselling centre was started a year ago under phase II of the National AIDS Control Programme (NACP). ,""Over the past few years it is being noticed that more women in Vadodara are contracting the disease. If the male to female ratio was 4:1 a few years back it is 1:1 now.

Patients can also avail free counselling sessions through a toll free number 1097. ,Apart from keeping track of the number of patients getting affected, the centre also analyses sexual behaviour in high risk groups. ,""Nearly 40 per cent of the total cases in Vadodara had become susceptible to the disease because they underwent a blood transfusion and women are in a majority. This is because most women are in need blood during pregnancy. A detailed investigation revealed that most of the HIV testing for blood done by blood banks was faulty, where three different samples of blood were mixed before the appropriate reagents were added for confirming the presence of the virus. It was basically a cost saving measure employed by the banks, since HIV tests are costly,"" adds Marfatia.,""A majority of the HIV cases are prevalent amongst the migrant industrial worker population in the outskirts of the city and nearly 20 per cent are cases where three to four people share a single room.

But if it becomes affordable, I would certainly like to take the drugs,a� she remarked in a matter-of-fact manner.,aœUsed in the first line of medication are two drugs and proteas inhibitor regime consisting of a˜Lemivudinea™ and a˜Zidovudinea™ which are priced today between Rs 1,500 and Rs 2,000 per month, compared to Rs 18,000 or Rs 20,000 earlier.,However, it still remains unaffordable for the poor sections,a� said Dr Samir Shah, deputy director of ESIS and project director of National Aids Control Organisation (NACO) from Vadodara.,Gujarat State Aids Control Society (GSACS) additional director Dr D M Saxena says, aœWe are trying to tie up with insurance companies, to give some cover to HIVaffected persons.a�,aœIf a patient discontinues treatment and then resumes after some time, the medication becomes costlier and less effective,a� explains infectious diseases consultant Dr Atul Patel. Of the 42 lakh HIV+ve patients in India, Gujarat accounts for about 3,400. Going by the GSACS data, an HIV patient has to spend as much as Rs 2,333 every month on treatment and tests.,But price apart, these drugs are not even easily available. This, despite the governmenta™s decision of exempting anti-Aids drugs from excise and Customs duty to bring down the cost of ARV therapy by nearly 25 to 30 per cent.,A majority of those who acquire the HIV virus are daily-wagers who can''t even afford Rs 1,000 per month on treatment. Moreover, government hospitals,which are preferred by this segment of society, invariably don''t have the drugs. Vadodara-based Aids counsellor Dr Sandeep Shah said, aœThe ARV therapy has to be continued for a lifetime. In this situation, the therapy continues to be expensive for poor people. Ita™s not possible for someone who earns Rs 5,000 to spend Rs 1,800 on a monthly basis for continuing the therapy.a�"

Her joy is doubled, not just because she has a healthy baby, but because the decision to be a mother was an unusual one.,Ms Patila™s husband is HIV-positive and the Patils chose to have a baby through a donor sperm. This meant that the child is biologically that of the mother, but that the sperm medically implanted was that of a donor.,Ms Patila™s husband, Pritam (name changed), was educated and an eligible match. But when the 22-year-old tested positive for HIV in 1994 his world seemed to cave in.,However, three years later, he married Nirmala after admitting to her that he was HIV-positive. As they longed to be parents they were faced with an agonising dilemma. Could they take the risk of having a baby and perhaps passing on the virus? An HIV-positive couple may or may not pass on the virus to their child.,Though Ms Patil had tested negative for the virus, the Patils did not want to take any risks for their child. Intensive discussions with family members and counselling sessions with Dr I. S. Gilada, followed. Finally, the Patils opted for artificial insemination.,Mr Patil was offered the choice of storing his own semen for about six months at a low temperature which might kill the virus. But as he said, aœI didna™t think it was a completely safe or viable alternative.a™a™ Besides each round of cryopreservation would set the Patils back by at least Rs 20,000, Dr Gilada warned.,Mr Patil was also worried in case cryopreservation failed to kill the virus. That left the option of using donor semen. Taking the decision, he confesses, was not an easy one.,aœMy wife was initially hesitant. For obvious reasons,we wanted our own child. But over time, she grew to accept that this was the second-best option. We felt it is better to have a child who, is at least, biologically ours to some extent.a™a™,The Patils case is a rare one.a�Such incidents of artificial insemination through donor sperm are rare because people want their own child and secondly, awareness is very low,a™a™ said Hrishikesh Pai, infertility specialist.,He said for HIV couples who want their own child there is another alternative a"" bringing down the HIV viral load in the husbanda™s semen and then inseminating the woman. ,aœIn such cases, the triple drug regimen for HIV patients is administered to the person to bring down his viral load. If the load is undetectable after treatment, we test the semen because it may still carry the virus in high quantities. If the semen sample too tests negative for the HIV virus, we wash the semen sample and induce an artificial pregnancy,a™a™ explained Dr Pai.,Experts say that though studies have shown the risk of HIV transmission in persons with a low viral load is very low, there is always some degree of risk. This makes the option of donor sperm insemination a safer choice, though, as infertility expert Aniruddha Malpani says, aœPsychologically, such choices are difficult to make.a™a™"

These children are often victims of abuse, exploitation and neglect, and need to be educated,"" says Jyoti Dinesh, project co-ordinator of Street children Project.,The meeting focused on breaking myths about the disease and elaborate on the evils of unprotected sex. ""I have a serious health problem, and it appears to be HIV. Medicines have not helped me. But this ''tavees'' around my wrist has given me relief.

E-mails and SMSes are increasingly functioning as SOS flashes for families desperately looking for blood donors.,While blood banks are still the first port of call in emergency cases, families prefer known donors for planned surgeries that require blood transfusion. aœHalf my patients prefer to go in for a known persona™s blood rather than from a blood bank,a™a™ says cardiologist B K Goyal.,Needless to say, the biggest fear propelling people towards a˜knowna™ blood is the HIV virus. Though all blood used for transfusion has to be tested for HIV, Hepatitis B and C, VDRL and malaria, none of the tests are conclusive thanks to the incubation period. ,aœThe incubation period for most of these diseases ranges from a few hours for malaria to six months for HIV,a™a™ points out HIV specialist Shashank Joshi. aœMost people thus think ita™s safer to use the blood of someone they know.a™a™,And what better way to spread the message than to use neo-tech? Not surprisingly, a˜Blood Wanteda™ e-mails and SMSes have become increasingly common. Narendra Desai, a businessman, followed the SMS route when he needed to stock AB negative blood, a rare group, for his three-month old sona™s surgery. aœMy frienda™s father got Hepatitis a˜Ca™ after a transfusion,a™a™ he says.,Mr Desai did not even bother to find out whether his sona™s blood group was available at blood banks. aœI did not want to take any chances, particularly as my son is too young. I eventually found my neighbour had the same group; he was healthy and had no bad habits,a™a™ he says.,Jimmy Mogal, a communications professional, who had heard stories of infections creeping in through borrowed blood, also went scouting for an O-negative blood donor among friends when a relative was due for a lung cancer surgery. aœWe insisted on getting blood from people we knew,a™a™ he says.,However, blood banks scoff at this cautious approach, and point out that they take all safeguards to ensure that their stock of bloodbags is as safe as it can possibly be. ,In fact, they insist that blood from a relative is more risky. An official at a blood bank cites the instance of a mother getting HIV after she was given her sona™s blood. aœHe didna™t know how to refuse to give blood for his mother. The mother is now paying for it,a™a™ he says.,Dr N.K. Naidu, medical director of the Indian Red Cross Society blood bank, corroborates the point. aœWe totally discourage intra-family donations,a™a™ he says. ,aœFirst, most relatives will not confess to high-risk behaviour, if any. Secondly, there is a huge risk of a patienta™s body reacting to a close relativea™s blooda""this is known as the graft vs host disease (GVHD).a™a™,Moreover, aœknowna™a™ blood is as much of an infection risk as blood from banks, Dr Joshi says. aœNo blood is foolproof,a™a™ he declares. aœIt is a myth perpetuated by TV serials and cinema that known blood is safe.a™a™ ,There are 22 possible bloodborne infections like pneumonia and malaria that can be passed on through a transfusion, irrespective of whether the blood is from a bank or family. Thankfully, experts say, the risk is marginal.,One more issue: all the trouble of finding a safe donor may not really be worth it as there is no guarantee that the patient gets the blood donated for him. aœMost hospitals follow the FIFO (first-in-first-out) principle,a™a™ says secretary of the Federation of Bombay Blood Banks, Dr Neelam Nijhara.,aœThey may not respect a patienta™s demand that only blood donated by his relative or friend be used for blood transfusion.a™a™"

According to protocol, HIV status is revealed only when the patient gives his consent for a test. If blood donated for transfusion tests positive for HIV, it is not disclosed to the patient. The blood is quietly discarded.,Prior to a voluntary test, the patient needs to be explained every aspect of the infection.

""In 50 per cent of the cases there are no symptoms at all,"" said Bhakuni, adding that one must go in for a test to be sure that one had not contracted the virus.,Since the test was based on antibodies forming after the virus entered the body, the results could be varying, he said. While a three-month period was considered sufficient for the test to give the result, ideally the person must be tested after six months too, he stressed. This was essential for people who had a slow immune system, Bhakuni explained.,Speaking at the concluding session of the two-day CME programme on ''Emergencies in medical practice'' at the Command Hospital on Sunday, Bhakuni said that health care workers (HCW) were at a major risk of contracting the disease. ""India has approximately 5.1 million HIV positive cases and our armed forces population has not been spared. In our service hospitals we come across HIV patients for review, treatment and also the newly diagnosed ones,"" said Bhakuni, adding that they were being attended in all the disciplines of medicine and surgery resulting in exposure of HCWs.,""The operation theatre staff, nurses, nursing attendants and safaiwallas are particularly exposed to the accidental HIV infection by needles, blood and body fluids, he said, stressing that there is a need for awareness among the HCWs regarding the post exposure prophylaxis (PEP) against HIV infection.,Bhakuni mentioned that although the first case of HIV infection was reported in 1981, the guidelines for PEP were formulated in 1998 in USA based on clinical studies on anti retro viral (ARV) drugs as Zidovudine and Nevirapine. The last revision was done in March 2003 as newer drugs kept surfacing. Zidovudine reduced the risk of developing HIV infection by 81 per cent when given as PEP. There are no clinical trials on PEP hence it is based on evidence based medicine and opinion of the experts. ,The ultimate goal of PEP, he said, is maximal suppression of any limited viral replication and to shift the biologic advantage to host cellular immune system to prevent early infection. Hence ''highly active anti retroviral treatment'' (HAART) regimen has been recommended. After exposure the local replication of virus occurs in the host macrophages or dendritic cells. The host cytotoxic T-cells will kill infected target cells. If the infection is not contained at this stage, it is followed within 2-3 days by replication of HIV in regional lymph nodes. Viremia then follows within 3-5 days of virus inoculation.,Given the rapid appearance of productively infected cells, regimens with the most rapid onset of activity, multiple sites of antiviral action and greatest strength such as HAART are most effective, he added.,Earlier, in the scientific session, Dr Rajeev Agarwal of King George''s Medical University (KGMU) outlined the steps in management of burns, while Lt Col SP Prasad of CH (CC) talked about ocular injuries. Col BK Chopra discussed long bone injuries while Wg Cdr MS Sridhar gave a talk on spinal injuries. Lt Col MD Venkatesh CH (CC) discussed foreign bodies in aerodigestive tract.

Other districts are Bellary (Karnataka), Guntur (AP), Kanpur (UP), Udaipur (Rajasthan) and Aizwal (Mizoram).,District project coordinator and AIDS Control Society member Haroon Rasheed said Kishanganj was selected mainly because ""it was one of the most under-developed districts in India"" with low literacy rates, female (18.49 per cent) and male (42.8 per cent), and also, on grounds of poverty and poor reach of social development efforts. Besides, there was low media access which was figured out as radio (1.6 per cent), TV (1.2 per cent) and newspapers (3.1 per cent).,He said because of the district being located on Bihar-Nepal border and close to Indo-Bangladesh and heavy migratory population, this was quite vulnerable to spread of sexually-transmitted diseases.,Additional district magistrate (ADM) Dilmohan Paswan said NGOs could provide invaluable services to Charca''s highly ambitions preventive campaign. Civil surgeon P Manjhi and chief administrative officer of MGM Medical College Dilip Jaisawal said the train passengers should be examined at the station at the time of boarding and before going to their respective villages."

High-level BSACS sources said out of the 5,510 persons tested during the check period at eight sexually transmitted diseases (STD), one MSM, two female sex workers and seven antenatal centres, only 37 tested HIV+. Out of the 2,775 pregnant women who underwent the HIV test at seven antenatal centres (ANCs), only six tested positive three at the Patna Medical College Hospital (PMCH), two at the Begusarai Sadar Hospital and one at the Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College Hospital (JNMCH), Bhagalpur.,The HIV+ prevalence rate was, however, slightly higher among those who underwent the test at eight STD centres.,Of the 1,985 persons undergoing the test at these centres during the check period, 26 tested HIV+. This included five HIV+ cases at the Duncan Hospital, Raxaul, one at the PMCH, seven at the Anugrah Narayan Magadh Medical College Hospital, Gaya, five at the Darbhanga Medical College Hospital, six at the Katihar Sadar Hospital and one at the JNMCH. Not a single HIV+ case was detected at the Ara Sadar Hospital where 250 persons underwent the test.,The most significant decline was noticed among the female sex workers of Chaturbhujsthan (Muzaffarpur) and Shravan Bazaar (Munger). Out of the 500 female sex workers who underwent the test, only one from Shravan Bazaar tested HIV+.,BSACS project director C K Anil said though 250 female sex workers of Chaturbhujsthan underwent the test, not a single of them tested HIV+.,Out of the 250 persons in the MSM category who underwent the test at the Patna MSM centre, four tested HIV+, he maintained.,Anil said emphasis on the HIV/Aids awareness programme and an increase in the number of voluntary counselling and testing centres (VCTCs) have resulted in the decline of HIV+ cases in the state.,The number of VCTCs has increased to 45 in the state with five of them located in Patna.

Moreover, employers victimising an employee because of his/her positive status is also liable to be prosecuted under the proposed legislation. ,Prepared by a group of lawyers fighting large-scale instances of stigma, discrimination that has haunted HIV/AIDS patients, the draft legislation is almost 90 per cent complete. ,According to project co-ordinator of the Lawyers Collective HIV/AIDS unit, advocate Vivek Divan, the project was taken up in August 2002 at the behest of Congress MP, Kapil Sibal who spearheads a parliamentary committee with the aim to build a consensus amongst politicians against AIDS in the country. Sibal is currently the union minister for science and technology. ,While the draft will be discussed with Sibal and an advisory working group consisting members of the Indian council of medical research (ICMR) and national AIDS control organisation (Naco) on December 4, Divan told TNN the basic idea is to protect and promote the rights of people living with HIV/AIDS (PWA), besides those affected by the epidemic and those most vulnerable to it.,""Considering the present environment where HIV/AIDS patients are subjected to stigma, violence and inequity, it is important to have a legislation, which will help in reducing such instances, if not eradicate them all, and create a non-discriminatory environment based on principles of human rights,"" he said. ,Joint director of the national AIDS control organisation, Sadhana Rout, only said that the draft is being readied. ""It will be finalised only after consultation with senior officials from the health ministry and other concerned organisations."" ,Although Sibal could be contacted, he had earlier told this newspaper that the proposed law is one of the most challenging tasks for policy makers, as it has to deal with human rights abuse of vulnerable individuals and groups against the society. ,While the penalty is yet to be finalised, Divan said the proposed legislation will prohibit denial/dismissal/unfair treatment to HIV/AIDS patients in both public and private, as well as organised and unorganised work sectors.,Not only these, it also promises to create safe working environment and adherence of universal precaution norms to all health care workers.,While the media has also been prohibited from publishing articles/news stories without consent of the patients, the proposed law also makes it mandatory for all research and healthcare institutions to seek prior consent from the patients before any testing, treatment or research on them. ,Divan said the unit has already completed consultations, at both the central and regional levels, with various NGOs, network of positive people and others concerned to get feedback. ""Important suggestions and recommendations are being carefully study so that that same can be integrated into the draft before being submitted,"" he said.,Although India has a national AIDS prevention and control policy, it does not have the status of a law, as a result of which it is not binding and enforceable in court. Organisations working in this field strongly advocate that in the backdrop of increasing cases of denial of treatment and discrimination, it is imperative that issues like consent and confidentiality, which till now are being governed by the common laws, should be dealt with separately.,Other salient features: ,* HIV/AIDS victims can access the highest attainable standard of treatment,* Naco and state AIDS control societies to be made statutory bodies,* HCEs and doctors to suppress identity of patients ,* Prohibit quackery and other forms of treatment which claim success to transmission of the virus"

The official NA-CO website explains in a most complacent manner, ""While the spread of HIV continues, there is no significant upsurge in the number of new infections and in fact the rate of growth of HIV has registered a slowing down."" NACO explains the conclusion by counting the estimated increase in numbers between 2001 and 2003. In 2002, it says there was an increase of 6.1 lakh HIV infections, but the number of new infections dropped to 5.3 lakh in 2003. Epidemiologist Dr L M Nath describes this conclusion as ""premature"". ""There is no evidence that the epidemic is under control. The number of infections in high risk population may have peaked and sto-pped growing any further, but HIV in the general population continues to increase,"" he says. Close to 5.2 million people are estimated to be living with the virus in India. Most of these numbers come from six states identified as high prevalence: Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Maharashtra, TN, Manipur and Nagaland. Poverty, illiteracy, women's lack of empowerment and unemployment which leads to migration are known to be among the main factors that drive the epidemic. For several of these reasons, the Indian epidemic has been showing a shift towards rural areas. In 1998, the urban-rural differential in HIV prevalence amongst pregnant women was estimated at 8:1. This has now narrowed down to 2.4:1. Of the 5.1 million infections, 3.1 are in rural areas. ""This alone is a cause for concern,"" admits an official. With the virus moving beyond the traditional high-risk groups such as truck drivers and sex workers, hospitals and private practitioners in cities too are getting an increasing number of patients from the middle and upper echelons of society.

"Roli Srivatsava,Feb 15, 2005, 23:04 IST",STD clinics boost HIV numbers,"HYDERABAD: Cold facts about the dreaded HIV/Aids scourge might be numbing, but one positive outcome of the spine-chilling statistics put out by health workers, is sexually-transmitted diseases (STDs) are out of the closet. In fact, Andhra Pradesh's high HIV/Aids prevalence rate, second only to Maharashtra, could also denote greater awareness among people. More people willing to subject themselves under the scrutiny of the electron microscope. In 1999, the state's prevalence rate of HIV/Aids was pegged at an alarming 2.63% (of every 100 individuals tested). This triggered a series of awareness campaigns and setting up of clinics for STDs. While the prevalence rate did show a gradual decline by 2003, health activists were alarmed when it jumped back to 2 per cent in 2004. A prevalence rate of over 1% is categorised as an 'epidemic'. Health officials said the figure has been computed from preliminary data, but admitted it's a cause for concern. While data received from two districts, Srikakulam and Warangal, are being re-checked and the National Aids Coordination Committee has been asked for a fresh survey in these two districts, the overall prevalence rate of 2 per cent is unlikely to change. Some districts such as Prakasam have shocked authorities as well with a high prevalence rate, a whopping 4 per cent. This is the first time such a high prevalence rate has been reported from this district. Guntur and Karimnagar too are among districts reporting high prevalence rates, 3.5 per cent. In Hyderabad, the prevalence rate has shown a decline over the last three years — from 1.5 per cent in 2002, it came down to 1.1 per cent in 2003 and 0.75 per cent in 2004. ""This (Hyderabad's figure) is a marginal decline,"" Andhra Pradesh State Aids Control Society (Apsacs) project director K Damayanthi said, adding that it is a fact that the epidemic is ""growing"". ""We still need to do a lot more in terms of awareness. We need to make young people perceive the risk and facilitate behavioural changes,"" Damayanthi said, explaining they still largely feel that they are not at risk. Despite the awareness campaigns, the young are still adopting a risky lifestyle, she said. Over 85 STD clinics and 105 voluntary counselling and testing centres have been set up across the state after the 1999 shocker, an APSACS official said. She said that the number of cases may have shot simply because there is greater awareness among people, who now visit these centres to get tested. The STD clinics, in particular, are visited by people with a high-risk behaviour who suspect or have symptoms of STDs. Interestingly, HIV prevalence among people with high risk behaviour is showing a gradual decline (See Box). It drives home one point clearly, behaviour is changing, say health activists. "

In 2000, Lakshya Trust, a community-based organisation working on HIV/AIDS awareness issues with MSM (men having sex with men) community, had faced similar reaction from residents. The situation has not changed even after five years. Ironically, the HIV positive group in question this time was to start a project to fight stigma and social discrimination against the HIV-infected. ""With this incident, we had a taste of what was awaiting us. We were forced to move out of Mamani Pol after residents opposed to having an NGO working on HIV in their locality. For some days, we had to work from the SSG Hospital. However, we managed to set up office and drop-in centre at Amdavadi Pol. But we are still afraid of putting up a board,"" says Atul Raorani, president of the HIV positive group. Says Pritesh Shah, project officer of the state government-funded HIV/AIDS Care and Support Project, ""Our project aims at sensitising people at large to reduce the stigma, peer counselling and clinical management of HIV-related illnesses. Our effort is to create employment for the HIV- infected and support education of children orphaned by HIV and women living with HIV. This apart, we hope to reduce the cost of anti-retrovirals (ARV) through corporate sponsorship."" Social stigma is perceived to be a major challenge to HIV prevention, say NGOs working on HIV/AIDS. ""Instances of discrimination reflect on severe lack of awareness about AIDS among the masses and the urgent need for attitudinal change. Unless the masses are sensitised, fear of stigma will discourage HIV patients from seeking medical care and counselling which, in turn, proves detrimental to HIV prevention,"" say Vaishali Ajmera, project officer of HIV/AIDS project, Vikas Jyot Trust. The Gujarat government has mooted a draft Act to extend legal support to the HIV- infected. The proposed Act will address various issues like social and medical discrimination, quality of life and enabling environment for the HIV-infected. Says additional director of the Gujarat State Aids Control Society (GSACS) DM Saxena, ""A major social transformation is possible with legal modifications. HIV is no more restricted to high-risk groups but has filtered down to the general population. This has made amendments to the existing laws inevitable."" Despite having laws like right to life, we have no legal authority to take action when a HIV patient is denied medical care. ""Moreover, as we hardly receive any official complaints from NGOs or the victims, advocacy for their rights has become difficult. Most victims of discrimination refuse to file a police complaint,"" adds Saxena. Meanwhile, the NGOs argue that legal provision alone will not suffice. As HIV is no longer confined to high-risk behaviour groups, the government must involve the mainstream society in eradicating social stigma, they add. Says Sylvester Merchant, project officer of Lakshya Trust, ""Social awareness and legal provisions must go hand-in-hand. Perhaps, a mass awareness campaign and public dialogue on the issue will help eliminate stigma. Unfortunately, most of our HIV interventions are target-oriented, aimed at high-risk groups, contact groups or stake holders like doctors, lawyers and police, who directly interact with the HIV-infected.""

Although the man has challenged the decision claiming his form has been mixed with another candidate and that he is not HIV positive, the Delhi High Court on Wednesday took a serious view of the issue. Justice Vikramjit Sen has issued notice to the Union government and asked them to place a policy regarding employment to a person suffering from HIV. ""The matter is of great importance as well as of urgency,"" said Justice Sen. Manoj Ohri who appeared on behalf of the Union of India accepted the notice. According to Ohri, the petitioner was probably medically examined in Nasik in January 2005, a month after he sat for the interview. ""I have called for the petitioner's files from the ministry,"" said Ohri. The petitioner, Jogendar Singh, filed his petition in the court challenging Hindustan Aeronauticals Limited's decision to deny him employment. Singh claimed somebody else's photograph was affixed on his form. In fact, even in Singh's appointment letter, the photo belonged to the other man. Although he had informed HAL about the mistake, the latter promised to rectify it. But the error was apparently ignored. Singh claims that the man whose photograph was pasted on his form could be HIV positive. To substantiate his argument, Singh also produced two medical certificates, one from S N Medical College, Agra, and the other from AIIMS declaring him HIV negative. Although Justice Sen empathised with Singh, he found the rejection ridiculous more on the ground that the man was HIV positive.

"May 16, 2005, 01:19 IST",HIV-hit cops in city to get free treatment,"MUMBAI: Given the growing incidence of HIV among policemen, the Mumbai police has decided to provide free antiretroviral (ARV) treatment to its affected employees. According to the latest statistics, the police force has 340 HIV/AIDS-af flicted personnel. In 2002, a police constable attached to the Local Arms Unit of the Mumbai police, suspected to have contracted the HIV virus, committed suicide. In 2003, another constable jumped from the third floor of the Nagpada police hospital after he learnt that he was suffering from AIDS. It is to help affected policemen lead normal lives that the ARV treatment—a cocktail of two or three drugs—will be distributed free of cost. The drugs which have to be taken for the rest of the patient's life are expensive and many patients are not in a financial position to continue with it. ARVs are known to control the viral load and thus increase the life expectancy of the affected person. The Nagpada police hospital—the only hospital for the city's 39,000-strong police force—had so far never stocked the ARV drugs. However, the top brass felt that the unavailability of the drug meant that affected policemen kept away from the hospital. "

A survey has found that one person in every five married is having sex with a non-partner and only 25 per cent people are using condoms with non-partner sex, she said. ,The age profile of people found positive clearly shows that majority of them were young (45 per cent in the age group of 15-29 yrs) followed by the people in mid-thirtes (35 per cent in the age group of 30-39) and 3.66 per cent in less than 14 years, Damyanthi said., Major causes and determinates of HIV/AIDS identified in the state include the high prevalence of sex with non-regular partners and lower rates of consistent condom use with non-regular partners, the project director said.,The project director quoting a survey said Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STDs) were found to be highest among sex workers with 25 percentage followed by migrant workers 17 per cent, MSM and transgender 15 per cent and composite groups 12 per cent. ,The presence of high number of migrant population and a vast...,... network of national highways passing through the state are some of the reasons for the increase in the number of cases, she said.,She said it was feared that if the government does not wake up to the threat of increasing HIV positive cases, particulary in Guntur, Prakasam, Cuddupah, Nellore, Karimnagar, Chittoor and West Godavari districts, the state may overtake Maharashtra.,According to a survey, the HIV prevalence rate exceeded one per cent among Ante Natal Care (ANC) attendees in the entire coastal belt of the state as well as a few districts in Rayalseema and Telangana regions.,Eighteen out of 23 districts at divisional level and 12 sites at sub-divisional level recorded more than one per cent prevalence among ANC attendees, she said. A high prevelance of 2.5 per cent was observed among the women registered for ANC and those who walked in for deliveries in hospitals set up with Prevention of Parent to Child Transmission (PPTCT) programme, Damayanthi said.,The Prevalence of HIV among antenatal mothers and also mother to child transmission in case of positive women, are very high in the state and warrant special attention, she said,There are 37 PPTCT centre working in the state and in these centres testing...,... is done free of cost for all the pregnant women. In addition Anti Retro Viral (ARV) drugs are being supplied free of cost to all the pregnant women who test positive to prevent vertical transmission, she said. ,The government has increased the number of STD clinics from 28 to 85 covering most sub-district hospitals. The STD clinics provide treatment facilities to cure infections.,Realising the gravity of the situation in terms of the increasing number of AIDS patients, high priority is being given by APACS to provide optimal care and support to infected persons, she said."

As a military official, earlier involved in the Armed forces AIDS control organisation (ACO), said, although the number of newly-infected ones in the defence forces has reached a ""plateau"" in recent times, troops still are a vulnerable lot because of their separation from families for unnaturally long periods.

"Jul 10, 2005, 23:05 IST",Cops cope with HIV,"In Punjab, policemen are being put through a comprehensive medical examination after seven cops in Ferozepur tested positive for HIV recently. The objective: to provide mental succour and financial support for the afflicted personnel., In Mumbai, HIV-positive cops may soon get expensive drugs free from the force. This follows another pro-active step taken less than 12 months ago when the force accepted an International Labour Organisation charter to become a HIV/AIDS-friendly workforce with zero discrimination., In Pune, afflicted policemen no longer able to undertake strenuous beat work are assigned to the desk work supervising pollution under control-testing units.,The tough-as-nails khakhi force does seem to acquiring a 'sensitive' dimension, courtesy the HIV/AIDS epidemic. The red-ribbon philosophy of reaching out to afflicted persons seems to be gaining acceptance as awareness meetings and counselling sessions begin featuring in a cop's diary.,But the dark side of all this exemplary response is what brought it about in the first place. Is it proof of the suspicion that the police now qualifies as a highrisk-behaviour group? Has the epidemic seriously penetrated the force?,The answer depends on who is being questioned. An activist from Hyderabad nods an emphatic yes. ""Policemen should be considered as part of a high-risk group along with commercial sex-workers, migrant workers and truckers,""he says.,But policemen disagree. ""The force is not a high-risk group,""says joint commissioner (administration) Subhash Awate. The incidence of AIDS/HIV wouldn't be more than it was in the normal population, he asserted. He has a supporter in Mumbai District AIDS Control Society chief Nirupa Borges, who categorically states that policemen do not fall into this ""hazardous""category.,But her counterpart in Bihar, Uday Kumar Ujjwala of BACS, has reason to believe that policemen are more at risk. ""Incidence of sexually-transmitted diseases is high among them,""he says, explaining that persons with STD have a 10% higher risk of HIV-AIDS because of the lesions that facilitate the virus' entry.,A survey done by BSACS, among enunchs living in Patna, recently revealed that they numbered policemen among their regular clients. ""We definitely consider the police force to be a high-risk group in the light of these findings,""says Ujjwala.,Non-governmental organisation Sakhi that has worked with commercial sex-workers in Patna, too, has found that cops are regular visitors. ""The sex-workers' clients from the police include men from the top to the bottom,""claims a Sakhi activist.,The Andhra Pradesh AIDS Control Society consultants who interact with the police say the prevalence is greater among personnel of the AP Special Police and those who are on night-patrolling. According to Indian Labour Organisation official S M Afsar, young recruits posted away from home and with easy access to paid sex are more vulnerable to the disease.,In conservative Pune, a fresh case of AIDS or HIV-positive is registered every four months at the Police Hospital situated in the headquarters.,Of course, no comprehensive study has been carried out across the country to study the incidence or prevalence of AIDS\HIV among policemen. Joint commissioner Awate of the Mumbai Police pooh-poohs claims that 185 policemen in his 39,000-strong force are HIV-positive. And officials in Bangalore point out that the exact numbers are not available as the identity of the person affected by HIV is kept confidential unless the victim volunteers or the matter needs to be taken up legally.,At a time when there is a raging debate over the number of AIDS/HIV persons in the country, it is not surprising that there isn't a number one can put to the policemen with AIDS. This is all the more reason, feels social worker Preeti Patkar in Mumbai, that the ""high-risk""tag should be avoided for policemen. ""I wonder if this is true numerically. Moreover, adding such tags only worsens matters like in the case with commerical sex-workers.""She adds that there is a need to sensitise various groups - ""be they policemen or high-paid executives""- about HIV and AIDS.,Says N Borges of the Mumbai District AIDS Control Society: ""There is definitely a need to sensitise people about the disease but not because of their so-called sexual behaviour. They often come in contact with blood in cases of accident or assault and they need to be aware about the pitfalls."",(Inputs by Abhay Mohan Jha/Patna, Mridula Chundur/Hyderabad, Gitesh Shelke/Pune and Paawana Poonacha/Bangalore)"

I am trying to get them back,"" said Shingare. ,Shingare's enthusiasm for the Brahma Kumaris is not shared by the Department of Medicine which handles the crucial Anti-Retroviral Therapy (ART) for HIV positive persons. ,Under the ART programme, J J Hospital treats 2,371 severely AIDS-infected persons in addition to nearly 4,000 patients with the HIV virus who have not developed AIDS. ,Free anti-retroviral drugs are given to the 2,371 persons (1,612 males, 758 females, 1 eunuch) every month for six months and later refills are given for two months after six months are over. ,On any given day there are five to nine new patients and on a crowded day, there are nearly 200-250 patients sprawled across every available inch of space in the ART department on the second floor. ,From the same place, anti-TB, anti-pneumonia and anti-fungal treatment are also given to HIV positive persons. Additionally, free condoms are distributed as a measure of HIV prevention. ,From one end of the small room extending to another adjacent small room, HIV afflicted persons wait their turn patiently for treatment. If they are lucky, they get a wee bit of space on a wooden bench outside. ,Since many of then suffer from opportunistic ailments like tuberculosis, the likelihood of infection spreading from one person to another is always a risk. Individual counselling is tough as the resources are minimal and therefore often there is mass counselling. ,Since there is lack of space and of resources, anti-retroviral drugs that are sent in bulk packages from New Delhi are stored on the fifth floor in one corner. Often the counsellors or ward boys along with the patients run up and down to fetch the medicines. ,At J J Hospital, where space and resources are at a premium, a spacious room exclusively for Brahma Kumaris was indeed a luxury. ,""What was needed was medical counselling. You cannot invite Brahma Kumaris to come and counsel HIV positive persons. The hospital is not a religious place where non-medical persons are needed and that too in a crucial department like HIV/AIDS. When we in the department are gasping for more trained personnel and more space, I wonder how we can justify such peace meditation,"" asked a senior person in the ART department. ,Earlier this week, the ART department recently became the first centre in India to give free treatment to small children who have been afflicted with HIV virus. ,Now with special oral medicines suitable enough for small babies, the ART department has started treating babies though storage and refrigeration for oral syrup is still a problem for poor patients. ,In addition to the existing 35 children, another 100-200 children are expected to be given treatment under the ART scheme. The ART department at J J Hospital is also fast becoming the most preferred centre for HIV treatment and patients often come from far off places in Bihar and UP instead of going to New Delhi. ,And almost all of them belong to the lower strata of the society. The patients, however, do not get any sort of railway concessions. ,This despite the fact that the chief of the JJ Medicine department, Dr Alka Deshpande, who is also in the charge of ART treatment, has written to the railway minister, Lalu Prasad Yadav urging him to give railway concession that is routinely given to other medically ill patients who use the railways to travel to any hospital for treatment."

The order, issued by primary and secondary education principal secretary T M Vijay Bhaskar, will come into effect from the current academic year and will be applicable to all schools . government, aided or unaided. ,""There is no need for schools to know about the HIV status of the child at the time of admission. There should be no discrimination against children affected by HIV or those whose parents are HIV-infected,"" the order says. ,In order to ensure effective implementation of the order, the department has instructed all deputy directors of public instruction and block education officers to see HIVinfected students are treated on par with others. ,DDPIs and BEOs, will in turn, give necessary directions to all school headmasters, about the new order. The government'fs action follows the story of an eight-year-old girl who was denied admission by Dakshina Kannada school in August, which was widely reported the media. ,This, officials say, is also to prevent any cases of bias against children affected by HIV as the state is one of the hotbeds of AIDS. Karnataka has the fourth highest number of AIDS cases in India. ,The department has also taken up HIV/AIDS education at government schools with assistance from the health department. ""Based on the information given by Karnataka State AIDS Prevention Society, we have printed information about AIDS and HIV in the inside cover pages of some textbooks for Class and 10,"" DSERT director Jagannath Rao said."

"Amarendra Jha,Oct 14, 2005, 21:01 IST",Ostracism of HIV affected fading,"SURAT: For 10-year-old Chinmay Kumar, an HIV+ve boy, social ostracism no longer exists. With over 2,000 people clapping while he was pinning the 'red ribbon'on guests during a function at the venue of 'Jai Ambe Ras Garba' near Puna Jakat Naka here on Thursday night, a new beginning was made. ,Standing ovation by the public indicated the likelihood of the gap between the likes of Chinmays and the rest being bridged. On the occasion, city police commissioner Sudhir Sinha lauded the efforts of the garba organisers. With both parents being HIV+ve, Chinmay, residing at Varachha here, too contracted it through them at an early age. ,Proper counselling has made the family lead a normal life.Chinmay is a student of class V. In a city, with an estimated 20,000 HIV +ive people, and around three of them dying on an average every month, there has been social segregation, mainly due to lack of awareness and the social stigma attached to it, says head of Gujarat State Network of Positive (GSNP) People, Surat chapter, Umesh Patel. ,Till recently, many among HIV+ve people in the city were scared to let others know, fearing social stigma, says Sonal Shroff of Lok Vikas Sanstha which works for creating awareness about HIV and AIDS in industrial belts like Hazira here. ,But with the intervention by NGOs, an ever increasing sensitisation is taking place, and not only the HIV +ive people are admitting it openly, they are also gaining social acceptance, Shroff adds. ,Last year during Navratri, around 10 of them sported T-shirts with inscriptions like 'Main Kaun Hoon? Main HIV +ive Hun' (Who am I? I am HIV +ive), but many failed to endorse this bold step, says Daksha Patel of GSNP here. ,But this time, hundreds of them came out in the open to mingle with others at the garba ground without any fear of ostracism, says Patel adding, ""At the garba venue itself, several stalls were set up for creating awareness."" ,With proper intervention, the spread of HIV could be contained to a great extent, but then the society at large would have to accept its responsibilities for adopting a humane approach to the issue, says an HIV +ive person Dina Limbachiya (31), residing at Katargam. ,Organising workshops, seminars and other events would have an impact only if adequate steps are taken to sensitise the society, says organiser of Jai Ambe Ras Garba Jayesh Liliyawala."
"Oct 18, 2005, 02:55 IST",'86 pc of HIV transmission is through sex',"CHANDIGARH: By 2025 as many as 50 million people in the country will be infected with AIDS. Out of this, 40 million can be saved only if there is 100 per cent use of condoms among commercial sex workers as 86 per cent of HIV transmission in the country is through the sexual mode. ,These startling facts and figures were revealed by the director general of National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO), Dr SY Quraishi, who was in town on Monday. NACO is initiating a special programme, PACT India ��� Partnership for AIDS Control and Treatment. ,As a vehicle to promote awareness about the disease and human rights for its victims, NACO has tied up with Art of Living besides entering into a partnership with CII. ""Active involvement of various sections of media, judiciary, education besides religious leaders is being sought to make the programme a success,"" said Dr Quraishi. ,Listing out various steps taken by the government to check the menace of AIDS Dr Quraishi said, ""Central Council of AIDS has been formed under the leadership of the Prime Minister and a conference of all chief ministers is scheduled to be held shortly. NACO is networking with 31 ministries. ,The aim is to identify states which are underperforming in the AIDS programme."" The number of centres providing anti-retroviral drugs is scheduled to swell from the existing 25 to 50 in the country. ,Speaking about the ARD centre at PGI Dr Quraishi said, ""Since the number of AIDS patients in the city per se is not dramatically high, the centre will be upgraded and given a boost in another two to four years."" Punjab is fast becoming a higher risk state due to its large number of carriers, which include truck drivers and migrant labourers. ,The state has already 2,034 HIV positive patients, 334 full-blown AIDS cases and 92 deaths reported due to the disease, till April 2005. Dr Sonia Trikha of state AIDS control society said the first phase of the national programme was from 1987 to 1999 and the second phase in now on. ,The first case from the region was reported in 1987 whereas the first case of Chandigarh was detected in 1992 and till now 4,797 HIV positive cases have been detected in the region with 248 in Chandigarh, said Dr Trikha."
"MRIDULA CHUNDURI,Oct 25, 2005, 00:22 IST",HIV prevalence rising among newly-weds,"HYDERABAD: Even as the government is contemplating the proposal of pre-marital HIV testing, the number of newly-weds turning out to be HIV positive is increasing in the state. At several HIV counselling centres in the city and around the state, 90 per cent of the support seekers are recently married young couples. ,""I have noticed this trend in the past one year, where women aged between 18 years and 25 years, who were recently married and contracted the disease from their husbands are approaching us in large numbers,"" said P V Ramesh, president of the NGO, Telugu Network for HIV Positive People (TNHPP) where all the members giving help are also HIV-positive. ,These young women are tested either at the time of their first pregnancy which in most cases is within one year of marriage or when their husbands fall sick or die. Statistics available with the AP State Aids Control Society (APSACS) show that 80 per cent of the women are monogamous or have relations with just one man, who is their husband in case of married women. ,For men, the means of contracting the virus are many. Experience of many NGOs providing counselling for the infected shows that a lot of young men are contracting the virus from having sexual relations with an older lady in the neighbourhood. ""They have physical relationships with these 'aunties' whose husbands are away. ,The 'uncle' would have contracted the disease during one of his tours and gives to his wife who in turn passes it on to the younger man. This young man gets married and infects his wife. The cycle is the same in the cases of almost every newly-wed couple who comes to us for counselling,"" said K Badri, a counsellor with the city-based NGO, Cheyutha. ,This means of contracting the virus is not restricted to a particular economic class. In many districts, there are cases of young boys who have indulged in MSM or male-sex-with-male. The TNHPP has been getting at least four to five cases of MSM in each district in the past year, where 16 to 18-year-old boys are involved. ,MSMs, truck drivers, sex workers all these come under the high-risk group. However, recent studies by APSACS show that even the general population is showing high-risk behaviour. The figures this year show that out of the total infected population in the state, 45 per cent are in the 15 to 24 year bracket and another 45 per cent in the 25-49-year bracket. ,According to the counsellors at the city-based Network for HIV Positive People where 'positives' counsel fellow 'positives', the high-risk group should now include college-going boys and girls as well. ""Many young college boys and girls are finding it easy to indulge in pre-marital sex as there are many brokers around the city who can provide them with a room at a nominal rate. ,They form more than 90 per cent of the people approaching us for guidance on what to do after being diagnosed HIV positive,"" said M Swapna, president of the network. ,However, these 'positive' people working to aid other 'positive' people, feel while pre-marital testing could be useful to some extent, there is no guarantee that either the husband or the wife would not indulge in unsafe sex after marriage. ""People should themselves start realising their moral responsibility to their partner and be safe,"" Swapna said."

"Ketan Tanna,Nov 10, 2005, 01:00 IST",At the receiving end: HIV+ spouses,"MUMBAI: For long, Indian housewives have silently suffered transmission of HIV from their erring husbands. They are now fighting back. Through sections of the Indian Penal Code that clearly defines the transmission of a disease as a method of causing hurt; they are seeking justice, jail sentences for their husbands and compensation. On the flip side, there are cases of innocent men who are taking their philandering wives to court. ,Thirty-four-year-old Savita Ambekar had been married for well over eight years. A teacher in a small municipal school of Mumbai, her husband Sunil Ambekar worked as an upper division clerk in a government concern. Savita thought she had a happy marriage with a daughter and an evidently doting husband. She did have her fights with Sunil when at times he would stay out at nights or say he had urgent work on holidays. But as always, he had an explanation. ,A persistent cough and skin rashes which refused to go away took her to a government hospital where she was diagnosed as HIV-positive, seven years after marriage. When Savita, who had never had any physical contact outside her marriage, gave the news to Sunil, instead of receiving sympathy she faced a barrage of allegations and insinuations. The hospital where she had gone for treatment and counselling guided her to an NGO. Determined to fight for her rights and dignity, she used all the help that came her way to go to court. She also charged her husband under Sections 269 and 270 of the IPC for hurting her (along with Sections 323 and 325 of the IPC).,Section 269 of the IPC states that whoever unlawfully or negligently commits an act which is, and which he knows or has reason to believe to be, likely to spread infection of any disease dangerous to life shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to six months or with fine or both. Section 270 stresses on malignant transmission. On the other hand, Section 323 defines punishment for voluntarily causing hurt, while Section 325 defines punishment for causing grievous hurt.,Another case concerns 28-year-old Nitin Kapoor, who appeared to love his wife Gauri Kapoor more with each passing day. The software engineer had met Gauri, a consultant interior designer, through a common friend. In the first half of this year, Nitin���s health deteriorated. Tuberculosis made his life miserable for many months and then he was diagnosed with skin cancer. A blood test also revealed that he was HIV-positive. Aghast at the discovery, he confronted Gauri who initially denied anything but later confessed to a brief fling with one of her clients. Outraged, Nitin has now dragged his wife to court and slapped a suit under Sections 269 and 270 read along with Sections 319 and 320.,Although the West has prosecuted people who had transmitted diseases knowingly or through criminal indifference, in India, that is yet to happen. For a long time, diseases were considered acts of god and accepted fatalistically as one���s lot. But things are changing. Both Savita and Nitin are among the few in Mumbai who have dragged their spouses to court. Helping them fight for their rights is a non-governmental organisation called the Lawyers Collective. ,""We are helping three women and two men who have registered cases against their respective spouses at a magistrate���s court in Mumbai,"" says Julie George, legal officer, of Lawyers Collective. In Delhi, there had been a case where a woman filed a criminal suit against her husband for transmitting the HIV virus but the suit made no headway as the husband died due to HIV virus complications. Alaka Deshpande, head of the medicine department and in charge of treating HIV patients at the government-run J J Hospital, says a majority of the HIV-positive women who come to the hospital have been infected by their husbands. ,(Certain names and professions have been changed to protect their identities)"

There is an option - that if either of the spouse is willing - the test need not be carried out. ,But this is not cutting much ice with those protesting the move.The decision has in vited strong protests from activists and lawyers. ,Senior advocate Colin Gonzalves told TOI ""any mandatory testing is wrong. Couples should rather be counselled and educated. If they want to get a testing done by choice after that, its their business. But a mandatory test can't be imposed on them."",According to advocate Aparna Bhat, ""Mandatory testing is a violation of human rights. Its similar to forced testing and is discriminatory."" Speaking to TOI from Mumbai, Narvekar said he would welcome suggestions from NGOs and individuals.,""Goa has a common civil code. So all marriages have to be registered irrespective of caste and religion. ,Now, we want all couples to marry with an HIV-negative certificate in hand. Cases have come up in Goa where women have found, after their marriage, that their husband is HIV positive or vice versa."",By that time, both partners have been infected, the minister claimed.

"Mar 25, 2006, 20:48 IST",Should HIV testing be mandatory before marriage? No,"Jhanavi Goswami, VP, Network of People Living with HIV,Any kind of mandatory testing is wrong. It is a violation of human rights. It's almost similar to forced testing, and is discriminatory in nature. How can the government even think of making HIV testing mandatory before marriage? ,Do we have the required infrastructure? In a country where its villages and small towns don't even have decent hospitals and laboratories, how does the government expect the people to get themselves tested for HIV? ,Even the expenditure involved, Rs 5,000, for testing, is very high. How can young couples, especially poor people, afford it?,Besides, there is no proper code of conduct for carrying out these tests. For a little money, negative reports can be purchased, and that will defeat the whole purpose of eliminating Aids. First, the government has to ensure that there isn't any tampering with the reports and only then think of going ahead with such a step. ,Unfortunately, we are years away from such a reality. It may seem ironical that being HIV-positive, I am so strongly advocating against making the test mandatory. ,But after having gone through it, I now know the real picture. And under no circumstance will I ever ask for it to be made mandatory. At the age of 16, when I was still in Class X, I was married to a businessman. ,Only after the marriage, did I get to know that he was HIV-positive. I was completely unaware of the consequences and the gravity of the situation. ,When he died in 1994, the year we got married, I was already infected and so was my unborn child. My daughter passed away soon after. My in-laws put pressure on me to leave and I went back to live with my parents. ,Today, I am a counsellor with the AIDS Control Society in Assam. And everyday, I meet women who have a similar story like mine. But that hasn't changed my opinion ��� I don't want the test to become mandatory.,Instead, I feel the government should consider making HIV counselling mandatory. To-be-married couples should be encouraged to go in for pre-marital counselling on Aids. ,The government can run awareness programmes whereby the entire community is involved. In fact, all religious leaders should involve themselves in counselling a couple. After all, more people are bound to listen to a religious leader. ,This will be the best way to make people aware and prevent Aids from spreading. Making testing mandatory will never solve the problem. Let's try to remove the problem from its roots.,(Jhanavi Goswami is HIV-positive) ,As told to Kounteya Sinha"
"Mar 25, 2006, 20:50 IST",Should HIV testing be mandatory before marriage? Yes,"Dayanand Narvekar, Health Minister, Goa,Mandatory testing of couples planning to tie the knot is the only way we can stall the menace of HIV from spreading in India. Every day, we get new cases of women who test HIV-positive just months after their wedding, thanks to an HIV-positive husband who passes on the disease to the hapless wife. ,Nearly 40% of HIV-positive people in India are women. What is their fault? Even today, arranged marriage is most common in the country. ,A woman is seldom asked about her opinion. It's only after marriage, when she is infected and the damage is done that she finds out about her husband's illness.,The predominance of arranged marriages means that most wives and husbands come together as virtual strangers. As such, there is no communication between them and hence, the woman can never know if her husband is infected. ,So, mandatory testing of couples for HIV will be the only way to stop such rising incidences. Therefore, we decided to make a HIV test mandatory for registration of marriages. ,We are amending the Goa Public Health Act for this reason. While the state cabinet has already shown its green signal, we will put the amendment before the state legislative assembly in July. Goa has a Common Civil Code. ,So, all marriages have to be registered irrespective of caste and religion. It will be easy to implement the mandatory testing plan. All couples will now be allowed to marry once they have the HIV-negative certificate in hand. ,The compulsory test rule is on the lines of a similar clause in the Goa Public Health Act in the 1900s, whereby small pox vaccination was compulsory for couples before they married. If the amendment comes through, Goa would be the first state in the country to have mandatory HIV test before marriage. ,In 1986, Goa had amended the Public Health Act, allowing health authorities to forcibly test anyone suspected of Aids. After this amendment, a certain Dominic D Souza was detained and quarantined for the first time in Goa. The Goa bench of Bombay High Court released him but upheld the legislation. ,The order clearly states that the couples cannot register their marriage unless they produce a certificate issued by the Goa Medical College or the directorate of health services or such other authority. ,The certificate has to clear that their blood samples have been investigated or tested at laboratories, centres, etc notified for the purpose. ,This way, we are certain, we can fight this deadly menace called Aids.,As told to Kounteya Sinha"

Comparatively, Kolkata is better off at 9.6%. The report has been forwarded to National Aids Control Organisation (Naco), WHO and the state government as well.,Assistant director of NICED's epidemiology division, Dr Kamalesh Sarkar,-- who headed the survey-- said, ""The findings are extremely disturbing. Bengal has long been considered a low HIV prevalent state.,However, figures show that we have already entered the medium prevalence zone with a prevalence of 5.6%. Kolkata stands at the threshold of high-prevalence zone. If proper targeted intervention projects are not implemented, HIV will assume enormous proportions."",The number of HIV positive persons per 100 in the high-risk group (read sex workers) in a particular year forms the base for calculation of HIV prevalence rate according to NACO guidelines. ,If the count is less than five, then a particular area is classified as a low prevalence zone, whereas, if it is more than five but less than 10, it is categorised as a medium prevalence zone. A prevalence rate of 10% or more puts an area in the high HIV prevalence group.,Nineteen districts were initially categorised into high, medium and low prevalent districts based on the estimated number of sex workers in each district.,While Kolkata and Darjeeling were chosen from among the high prevalent districts, East Midnapore and North 24-Parganas were chosen to represent medium prevalence zones.

This treatment ensures that an uninfected woman can have a healthy baby without having unprotected sex with her HIV-positive husband. Still not available in India, this treatment is becoming popular in Europe.,Speaking to TOI, AIDS scientist Suniti Solomon, who is also director of the Y R G Centre for Aids Research and Foundation, said: ""Even if they are married to HIV positive husbands, women across the globe still want to be mothers. ,Sperm-Washing treatment is a great new technique that can fulfil this desire without risking the woman's life. In this procedure, the semen of an HIV-positive man is taken, centrifuged in different gradients, removing the virus and then introduced into the woman's body. The woman then conceives without picking up the virus."",She added: ""Nobody in India is well versed with this technique. So we are sending a team of scientists to Atlanta to learn it. The faster we start this technique, the more lives we can save. ,At present, 20 lakh women are HIV-positive because their husbands were infected and didn't wear a condom. No instances have been found where HIV was present in the sperm sample following the washing treatment."",Saying that over 5,000 couples in Italy and kGermany have successfully tried this technique, renowned American AIDS specialist Kenneth Mayer had a word of caution. ,He told TOI: ""There is always a risk that the semen can remain infected in minute form even after washing.

Formed in March 2006, the committee includes four officials from NACO, two microbiologists, epidemiologists, two statisticians and two clinicians.,According to health minister A Ramadoss, the committee will have large scale data on the extent of drug resistance that the Indian Aids virus has developed by August 2007.,India at present uses three drug regimens under the anti-retroviral therapy (ART) programme. Two drugs among these three — Stavudine, Lamivudine and Nevirapine — are given in combination to decrease resistance among HIV positive patients. The drugs destroy the virus from different sides.,Resistance to these drugs would mean that the first line of drugs are failing to contain the infection and NACO has to immediately start second line alternatives, which are still not available under the government's Aids control programme and will have to be purchased, increasing cost of HIV treatment in India.,Speaking to TOI, officials in NACO said: ""The study will be done on two types of patients.

She, too, acquired the infection when she was five months pregnant and had her premature baby aborted, and that nearly cost her life.,Nevertheless, Yamuna picked up the threads of her life post-HIV and learnt to live life fully, thanks to some NGOs.

RDNP+ president Jagdish Patel, who is also HIV-positive, said, ""We faced lots of problems in convincing Rama's relatives for the marriage. ,The fact that both hail from different castes also proved to be a hurdle. But constant persuasion by our members and the couple's willingness ultimately made it possible."" ,Manoj, who is also vice-president of RDNP+, said that he has been HIV-positive for last six years, but did not know how he got the virus. Rama got the virus from her husband, who died of AIDS four years ago. ,Patel said that the purpose behind such marriages is to give a social status to HIVpositive people and also because they can understand each other's problems better than anybody else. ,The members of RDNP+ visualise creating an enabling environment for people living with HIV/AIDS where they have easy access to treatment, care and support and can exercise their rights without facing any discrimination, he added. ,Around 250 members meet and try to help each other at the support group meetings."

And of the 26% who did disclose their status, over 10% have reported discrimination. ,These are the findings of a first of its kind study on the socio-economic impact of HIV and AIDS in India, carried out by the National Council for Applied Economic Research (NCAER) and supported by the National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) and United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).,The study, based on the survey that spread over six states — Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Manipur and Nagaland — also revealed the different nature of discrimination.,After covering 2,068 HIV households and 6,224 non-HIV households and interviewing 2,386 people living with HIV and AIDS (PLWHA), the study has shown that while 29% have been refused loan facilities and nearly 30% have been denied promotion, benefits have not been given to 20% of PLWHA.,Over 16% were forced to resign and 10% forced to take voluntary retirement. The attitude of co-workers has also been discriminatory. While 42% felt they were neglected and isolated, nearly 29% reported being called names by their colleagues. ,The study also notes that around 14% of men and 12% of women PLWHA reported facing discrimination at health facilities, with the discrimination being slightly higher in urban areas.,The nature of discrimination is different with 25% being refused medical treatment or referred to another health facility, 40% feeling neglected and isolated and 30% abused and teased.,Women bear the brunt of the stigma. More women faced discrimination like neglect, isolation and verbal teasing in the family. The study has highlighted that women are supportive of their HIV positive husbands (12.4%) than men of their HIV positive wives (8.4%). ,An overwhelming majority (84%) of women in the sample informed their spouses immediately of their HIV positive status, while the percentage of men who did the same is much lower (69%). ,Nearly 5.5% of female PLWHA have been asked to leave home after testing positive in comparison to only 1.9% of the male PLWHA.,The study estimates that lost earnings due to morbidity or death caused by HIV and AIDS could pull down total household incomes of HIV households by 9.24% and this could, in the long term, have a deleterious impact on the economy as a whole in terms of reduced savings and investments.,According to the report, children from HIV and AIDS households also have lower enrolment and higher dropout rates, affecting the access, demand, supply and quality of education. The girl child was found to be more affected, being more likely to be withdrawn from school.,Since most of the HIV infected persons are not only in their prime working age but are also often parents of young schoolgoing children, the epidemic would have an adverse effect on many aspects of child well-being, the study notes.,More children from HIV households dropped out of school to take care of the sick or their younger siblings, assist in household chores or to take up a job as compared to non-HIV children. ,Reasons like 'not interested in studies' and 'education considered unnecessary' were higher for non-HIV households, a sign that education is valued in HIV households and that they are forced by circumstances to withdraw their children from school.,Among the reasons for low school attendance, 'parent unwell', 'not paid fees' and 'had to look after younger siblings' or 'attend to household chores' was higher for children from HIV households than those from non-HIV households."

And their conversion rate is extremely high, according to experts of World Health Organisation (WHO) working in different cities of the state.,Officials with the state TB cell estimate that at present one TB patient has the potential to infect 15 others, all because of the decline in immunity levels. ,According to state TB officer (STO) BK Agarwal, country's northern zone, comprising UP, has been marked as a high alert zone.,The annual rate of infection (ARI) in this zone, according to the state TB cell, stands at 95 cases per one lakh people as compared to the country's average of 75 cases. The rate is significantly higher in case of urban areas because of high population density. ,It is because of this, officials admit, there are chances of epidemic-like-situation if the prevalence rate is not brought under control.,Data available with the WHO consultants clearly mentions that there are nearly 2.3 lakh cases of TB in the state. This, despite all 70 districts of the state being covered under the directly observed treatment— short course (DOTS), the programme which was launched way back in 1995. ,Officials, however, claimed that at present more than 5 lakh patients have been put on DOTS therapy through 14,059 centres operating in various parts of the state. ,The national tuberculosis programme (NTP), it is learnt, had been declared as a failure by the government itself. It was found that the programme met only 30 per cent of the expected results. ,It has now been replaced by the Revised National Tuberculosis Control Programme (RNTCP). But the revised programme, officials admit, is yet to reach every nook and corner of the state.,""The diagnostic part of the disease is one of the most critical area which has to be taken into account. For there are instances wherein the doctors of various provincial health centres (PHCs) have not been able to diagnose the disease properly. ,As a result they were not able to avail the DOTS therapy in time,"" said a senior officer with the UP TB cell on condition of anonymity. ,Another constraint is low density of DOTS centres. Sources said that the department is now seeking help of NGOs and anganwadi workers by equipping them with proper training so that they can help in propagating the therapy in villages.,Moreover, the cell is now coming out with TB drugs especially meant for children."

"Aug 10, 2006, 00:20 IST",TB biggest killer of HIV+,"NEW DELHI: Tuberculosis has become the single largest killer of AIDS patients in India. Figures compiled by India's National AIDS Control Organisation has revealed a catastrophic trend — over 60% of AIDS patients contract and ultimately die of TB. ,What's worse, AIDS is fuelling a resurgence of TB in the country. Faced with this double plague, India has now decided to scale up and integrate the National AIDS and TB control programmes from 2006. ,Under phase three of the National AIDS Control Programme during the next five years, in which India plans to spend $2.5 billion, $500 million is being kept aside solely for treatment and care. ,By 2012, India plans to set up 2500 Integrated Counselling and Testing Centres in universities, hospitals and medical centers across the country. At present, there are 2815 ICTC that check AIDS patients for TB. ,According to Dr Kurien Thomas from Christian Medical College, Vellore, who has designed the NACP III programme, the additional ICTCs will test 21 million people, of whom 30 lakh are expected to have symptoms of TB. ,These people will then be referred to India's Revised National TB Control Programme. Also, the present Voluntary Counselling and Testing Centres, that check patients for AIDS, will be integrated into ICTCs. ,NACP phase II was completed in March and the next phase would be implemented during the 11th five-year plan. The implementation is likely to start from November in 2006. ,""Of the 5.2 million HIV infected Indians, over 10% are expected to have full blown AIDS. Every AIDS patient has 15% chance every year of developing TB, which shows that every AIDS patient will develop TB some time in their life. ,Under NACP III, we will confront both TB and AIDS together. When people become infected with TB and AIDS, it is almost always an irreversible formula,"" Thomas said. ,The issue of TB and HIV complimenting each other has become so serious that for the first time, experts have been brought together at the World AIDS Conference in Toronto, starting on Sunday to conduct separate sessions on the menace and specially discuss TB.,TB specialist Dr Bobby John, who will attend some of the TB-AIDS sessions, told TOI that TB kills over 1,000 people every day in India. And its interaction with AIDS patients is making it more lethal. ,India reports 1.8 million new cases of TB, which is 1/5th of the global TB burden. Nearly 370,000 people die of TB in India annually. ,""Studies have shown that the co-infection rate in India is as high as 60%. That's why we are beginning a TB-HIV module under our TB Control Programme. The need for early identification and treatment of TB is desperately urgent. ,TB and HIV/AIDS is particularly deadly in Indian states due to widespread stigma, low levels of awareness, poorly coordinated services and a lack of mobilisation at the local and national levels."""

HIV prevention makes treatment more affordable, and treatment creates opportunities for enhanced HIV prevention,"" the report said.,Focusing on five countries in the region for which there is adequate data Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka the report concluded that countries must tailor their HIV prevention programmes to suit their local conditions rather than rely on global or regional approaches."

"Sep 9, 2006, 23:39 IST",Private boost for cheap HIV drugs,"Last month, a global summit was told that a quarter of the AIDS-affected didn't have access to life-saving medicines. With India having about 57 lakh HIV-positive people, the largest in any country, the gap between demand and supply of drugs assumes alarming proportions. ,Despite the government providing free AIDS drugs since 2004, only 35,000 have benefited so far. The rest can't access them regularly. Hence, a move by pharmaceutical companies to provide AIDS drugs at discounted rates is welcome. ,This year, Emcure Pharmaceuticals Limited, in association with the Network of Positive People (NMP+) and the Indian Network of Positive People (INP+), launched two ""Taal"" pharmacies in Pune and Nagpur, where those with HIV/AIDS get medicines at subsidised cost. ,Says Arun Khanna, executive director, Emcure, ""The centres take care of those who don't have access to treatment and doctors, and also their psychological and immunological issues."" Emcure provides the drugs on a no-profit basis and the revenue generated by the centres goes to the networks. ,The average monthly cost of anti-retroviral drugs (ARVs) in the first line of treatment per person is Rs 500. Drugs for the second line of treatment are more expensive and cost between Rs 7,000-8,000 per month. In the Pune and Nagpur centres, 500 and 100 people, respectively, are receiving treatment. ,The company plans to open more centres, with two being set up soon in Namakkal in Tamil Nadu and in Aurangabad. Such a public-private partnership is running parallel to the governments. ,Says Umesh Patel, president of Gujarat Network of People Living with HIV/AIDS (GNP), ""Even though medicines are free from the government services, there's a high dropout rate because of poor quality of services. People have to wait in long queues for meeting the doctors and for ARVs. ,Also, testing takes two-three days. So they prefer to switch to private pharmacies."" According to Patel, the largest initiative for providing discounted ARVs is being done by Reliance HIV and TB Centre in Surat. ,It's a partnership of Cipla, Reliance, CII and of people living with HIV/AIDS. Here, drugs are provided free of charge for 15 days in a month. That means patients need to spend just Rs 250 per month. ,There's also the AIDSCare Network in Surat, says Patel, which gives Cipla drugs at Rs 90 per month. ""The company gives concessions but the Network too absorbs part of the subsidy,"" says Patel. Medicines for the second line of treatment are available here for Rs 1,200 per month. ,There are about one lakh HIV positive people in Gujarat. Of these, about 10,000 should get ARVs, says Patel. But government efforts cover just 1,500. There is, however, skepticism about some of the private efforts too. ,K K Abraham, president of INP+, says, ""Emcure has a vested interest in wanting to sell its AIDS medicines."" Patel adds, ""Emcure medicines are given out in government outlets because they give low quotations. But there have been complaints of side-effects and of the CD4 count (T-cell) going down after use of Emcure drugs."" ,CD4 count lowering generally indicates progress of the HIV infection. The irony: India is one of the world's largest suppliers of generic ARV drugs to the developing world. "

""This is to ensure that our children do not have to study an outdated curriculum,"" he said.,When a member in the audience raised the issue of discrimination shown towards children diagnosed as HIV+, Horatti said, ""We are planning to start a programme for teachers so that they do not discriminate against such students. They too have an equal right to education and childhood."",He hoped that the programme would help alleviate the current problem of students dropping out when an HIV+ student enrolls at a school.,Horatti also discussed the setting up of a committee to formulate a state education policy, which would be headed by former Department of State Education Research and Training (DSERT) director Jagannath Rao.

The first case of AIDS in Bihar was detected in Nawada in 1992. ,In the last two years, the number of such patients have shot up by over 3,500 and more than 100 have died due to AIDS. Around 64 per cent of the HIV victims are males.,On an average around 2,000 HIV patients are being detected every year in Bihar. Unofficially, even members of the society concede that the actual figure of HIV patients would be much higher.,Despite the claims of creating awareness on AIDS and HIV, patients hit by the dreaded disease still face social boycott. There are reports from Saharsa about one Shambhu Singh of Pama village who was left to die by his family members and co-villagers. ,Singh was working in Delhi and has been an HIV patient for the last three years. Earlier, there were reports from Darbhanga about the wife of an AIDS patient having to drag the body of her deceased husband to the cremation pyre because relatives and villagers refused to touch the body.,Earlier, an HIV patient was reportedly isolated and locked in a room at Darbhanga Medical College and Hospital. Apparently, the media publicity and awareness campaign launched by voluntary organisations is still to evoke the desired public response.,Sources said a major chunk of HIV patients in Bihar are migrant workers returning to the state after being affected by the disease in Mumbai, Kolkata, Delhi and other places. ,Not surprisingly, the growth of HIV patients has been alarming in eight districts of North Bihar due to largescale migration of labourers. These are East Champaran, West Champaran, Khagaria, Madhubani, Purnia, Kishanganj, Muzaffarpur and Sitamarhi.,But it is not just the large number of migrant labourers the state has to worry about. The state has been identified for trafficking of women especially in areas located near the Indo-Nepal border.,There are 22 identified red light areas having about 3,000 sex workers in Kosi area alone, according to an NGO Bhoomika Vihar. ,The number rapidly increased during the past five years. “Its anybody’s guess what the actual figure of HIV patients in Bihar will be if sex workers and their clients are tested for HIV,” said Arun Kumar the convener of Bhoomika Vihar."

Little did he know that this would open a whole new can of worms. ,Health department officials, who visited the village of 3,000 people a fortnight ago and tried to get its residents to sign up for rehabilitation, have found that of the 10 blood samples they collected during an impromptu check up, seven have tested HIV positive.,While the alarmed health department officials are back to haunt the village again — this time with an official from the Chandigarh-based AIDS Control Society, the scared villagers have either fled the scene or retreated into a shell. ,This time the officials have managed to collect 24 blood samples. ,Most villagers are in denial that they could be on the threshold of an AIDS epidemic. Sarpanch Hari Singh, who had sought help to rid the village of drug addicts, says the problem began about two decades ago, when people developed chronic pain after years of drinking contaminated water. ,""What began as complaints of joint pain soon led to most of the village getting addicted to some pain killer or the other,""he said, adding that the village got fully hooked to drugs sometime around by 1998 by which time ""morphine injections were easily available in the village, though at a higher price""."
"Radhika D Srivastava,Oct 26, 2006, 01:24 IST",Six Bihar cops test positive for HIV,"PATNA: HIV/AIDS has suddenly become a talking point in the Bihar police. After a recent mass testing of 400 to 500 police employees, rumours are flying thick and fast on who all are HIV-positive. ,Officially, about six constables have so far tested positive for HIV in the Patna police lines. But the grapevine has been agog with reports of some senior police officers too, testing positive. ,The police and the state government have denied the rumours. But home commissioner Afzal Amanullah told TOI, ""HIV is a matter of concern for us. We want to carry out tests on our police employees but will keep the identities of the positive persons confidential."" ,Amanullah, however, denied that he had confirmed the positive status of two senior officers, even though a news agency quoted him. ,""Our testing will not be in isolation. We have made provision for providing anti-retroviral drugs to those who test positive so that the onset of full blown AIDS is delayed,"" he said. ,He added that the force would ensure that those employees who have tested positive were not discriminated against. ,""Wives of the HIV+ constables have also tested positive and arrangements have been made to provide them with ARV drugs as well,"" the home commissioner said. ,Police lines hospital head Dr P Ojha on Wednesday said recent sample surveys in various districts had shown alarmingly high incidence of HIV in general population. ,""This triggered an alarm in the police force and we started conducting voluntary tests,"" he said, adding, ""Since an earlier health check up had found a high incidence of venereal diseases (VD) among police personnel, we were eager to carry out HIV tests as a person suffering from VD becomes more prone to contract HIV."" ,Ojha said a large number of police constables stay away from their families for months and are often posted in remote areas, thereby becoming prone to high risk behaviour changes. ,""We intend to create awareness about HIV in the forces so that people come forward for tests and those who test positive can be provided timely treatment,"" he said. ,Admitting that the awareness level on HIV is extremely low, especially among the junior police personnel, Dr Ojha said, ""Our state is endemic to kala-azar which is known to suppress immunity of the infected persons.

"Oct 25, 2006, 03:14 IST",Pregnancy kits for HIV tests,"KOLKATA: This was too good to be true: the number of HIV cases actually showed a drop in the state this year till August. The state was relieved. What it did not know was that patients who had turned up for HIV tests were actually being tested for pregnancy, thanks to dud kits.,At the heart of the problem is Monozyme (India) Ltd,which is being probed for supplying these dud kits. The director of this Secunderabadbased drug firm, jute baron Govind Sarda, was arrested last month. What Monozyme did was fairly simple: it fooled around with nitrocellulose strips, which are used for testing HIV, Hepatitis B and C, and pregnancy. But the composition in the strips vary for the different tests.,For HIV tests, the strips are fitted in Cromatography Immuno Array (CIA), a rapid test kit. Several hospitals and blood banks in Bengal use this. CIA, however, is only a screening kit, and a further confirmatory test is required after this, but this is seldom done.,Monozyme broke the first rule when it sold HIV test kits (both Elisa and CIA) which were not capable of performing the P-24 protein test. The P-24 test helps detect HIV at an early stage, making early medical intervention possible.,""Some district hospitals and blood banks objected to Monozyme's kits, but nothing came of it,"" a source said. Next, Monozyme reportedly slipped in the nitro-cellulose strips used for pregnancy tests in the HIV test kits (CIA). ""Now, all these kits have a control band. If only this is highlighted, it means the test is negative,"" said a source. Most tests — obviously — were negative. ""What else would one expect when victims, including males, were only being subjected to pregnancy tests?"" he said.,As a result, the total number of HIV cases detected in the state dropped this year. In 2004, an average of 4.5 persons were detected with HIV. This went up to 6.4 in 2005. Then came Monozyme, and it looked like HIV was a thing of the past. While the fraud lasted, Monozyme minted money.,""By excluding the P-24 test, it managed to bring down the cost of each kit to Rs 27-28, way below the Rs 120 it sells for. It made even more money by using the pregnancy test strips, which costs Rs 3 apiece,"" the source added."

For another, it will not be delivered through long lectures and boring sermons, but through the medium of games.,Games—be they online, board or of the outdoor variety—will be used to drive home the message that ABC in an age of AIDS\HIV stands for abstinence, be faithful and condoms.,So, an online cricket game at a few NIIT centres will be interspersed with teenagers Amar and Tara talking about ""main jawan hoon, nandaan nahin (I am young, but not immature"". A board game, a la KBC-style quiz, will test one's knowledge on the dreaded disease as well as other general topics. The idea is clearly to deliver anti-AIDS\HIV messages as part of fun and games.,""Youngsters don't like to be lectured. They are likely to switch off the moment they realise they are being advised. So, we made an effort to devise a campaign that spoke their lingo and didn't preach,"" said Sonalini Mirchandani of Joh-ns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, which has come up with the Amar and Tara theme for AVERT-India.,AVERT-India is funded by the USAID and works in seven districts of Maharashtra such as Mumbai, Thane, Nagpur, Solapur, Satara, Aurangabad and Sangli.,The need to target the youths cannot be overlooked considering that 33% of those hit by HIV belong to this age group. India has over 5.1 million AIDS\HIV-positive persons.,To sensitise the youth, the game kit will be distributed to the 75 non-governmental organisations that are funded by Avert-India in these seven districts. ""Even some NIIT centres in these areas will load our games on their computers,"" added Mirchandani.,The games were inaugurated in Aurangabad by AVERT-India project director Dr S M Sapatnekar on Tuesday. ""It is a conscious decision to underline not just condoms but even abstinence and fidelity as keys to AIDS\HIV prevention,"" he said.,Addressing a gathering of over a thousand students from Aurangabad district, he said that although the AIDS\HIV epidemic had assumed worrisome proportions, there is no denying that it could have been worse. ""If India has not suffered like Africa, it is only because of the Indian culture. Here, family as a unit is still supreme,"" he said.,It is keeping the Indian sensibilities in mind that the ABC approach—originally devised in African nations that had lost almost 25% of its populace to the AIDS\HIV pandemic—is now being widely adopted in India, he said.,Experiences of local NGOs in Aurangabad lend credence to this belief. ""When we started HIV\AIDS interventions around three years ago in Aurangabad's slums, we realised that people were squeamish when we talked about condoms. So, we adopted the ABC message instead of just talking about condoms. We even started integrating routine health programmes with AIDS\HIV messages. This works in grabbing the attention of people,"" said Dr Rajesh K of the Babasaheb Ambedkar Arogya Abhiyan, which is funded by AVERT."

However, only those children with a CD-4 count less than 15% are being put on Anti Retroviral Therapywhile the rest are being put under counselling and observation.,India is also making CD-4 count test free for children. Adults, however, have to pay Rs 250 for the test. The CD-4 count tells the doctor how strong the immune system is and the stage of the HIV infection.,Speaking to Times of India, National Aids Control Programme director general K Sujatha Rao said, ""We are undertaking a survey to identify the load of paediatric HIV cases in India. We have started with the four high prevalence states. ,Once children are found to be HIV positive, CD-4 count is being undertaken to know the viral load. Since Clinton is providing us with the paediatric drug formulations for 10,000 children, we hope to identify the children in need of the drugs before he arrives."",India is also procuring 19 Qualitative Polymerase Chain Reaction machines (PCR), the only diagnostic tool in the world that accurately detects the presence of HIV in children aged below 13.,According to National Aids Control Programme, 33,000 new-borns get HIV every year from their infected mothers. Over 50% of these children die within two years of birth while 80% of them die within five years.

Indian studies, on the other hand, put the rate of incidence at 56%.,A study conducted by scientists from SBMP medical College and Hospital and Research Centre, Bijapur's department of Dermatology, Venereology and Leprology found that the prevalence of SD in HIV-positive and AIDS patients is between 34% and 83%.,The study said that SD's incidence and severity are closely related to the stage of HIV infection. ,More severe, widespread disease in the HIV infected, with more lesions, has led to the suggestion that the clinical picture seen in HIV infection-AIDS should be termed as SD-like....,..... dermatitis of AIDS and should be regarded as a distinctive entity caused by immunological defects.,As the disease becomes more advanced, the lesions spread and exacerbate. Stevens told TOI: ""SD is increasingly becoming common in HIV patients. We have, therefore, started to see SD as an early warning sign for HIV. ,SD causes redness of the skin and produces a yellow flake. Rashes occur mainly on the scalp and around the eyebrows, ears and moustache. ,Some HIV-infected individuals have had SD rashes on the chest, back, armpits and groin. The cause of SD is not known but a yeast Pityrosporum ovale does play a role in the disease."",Indian Trichologist Dr Akshay Batra added: ""SD is one of the most common skin diseases experienced by HIV-infected individuals. However, every patient suffering from SD will not be HIV positive. ,A health care provider should, therefore, evaluate cases of SD that do not respond to typical over-the-counter treatments.

"Feb 17, 2007, 01:20 IST",First-target cells of HIV identified,"NEW DELHI: Researchers from the University of Washington in Seattle have, for the first time, found exactly how the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) enters the female body during sex and which are its very first-target cells in the vagina.,The discovery provides hope to a devastated scientific community working on developing an effective microbicide, to help women protect themselves against HIV, after clinical trials of the most promising anti-HIV vaginal gel were recently halted in India and Africa. The gel was found to heighten the risk of contracting HIV rather than providing protection.,Now, the knowledge of how the vagina allows the virus to enter the body will provide a crucial boost for these scientists to discover the most effective microbicide. Microbicides are creams or gels that aim to block HIV from invading a woman's body.,Using a unique model system they developed, the scientists found that HIV-1 simultaneously enters two different types of cells in the vaginal epithelium (outer lining of vaginal cells) associated with the immune system — Langerhans cells (LC) and CD4+ T-cells — but through different mechanisms. The scientists reported in the journal Immunity, that both LC and CD4+ cells move out of the vaginal epithelium after the infection.,Researcher Julie McElrath reported, ""Understanding the initial events in the establishment of vaginal HIV type-1 entry and infection has been hampered by the lack of appropriate experimental models. We have now shown that upon contact, HIV-1 rapidly penetrated both LC and CD4+ T-cells. HIV-1 entered CD4+ T-cells almost exclusively by CD4 and CCR5 receptor without requiring passage from LC. By contrast, HIV-1 entered LC primarily by means of multiple receptors. Our findings shed light on the very earliest steps of HIV infection and may guide the design of effective strategies to block local transmission and prevent HIV-1 spread."",Scientists have for long known that HIV-1 enters CD4+ cells by interacting with a protein called CCR5. But the researchers wanted to know what happens when women are exposed to HIV through vaginal sex. The team then used a chemical treatment to separate the outermost layer of vaginal skin from the underlying tissue. They then exposed this layer to HIV viruses that had been tagged with a glowing dye. The team could then see which cells the viruses had infected. Within two hours, HIV had attacked the CD4+ T-cells, and infected almost half of them. ""Now we know that any effective microbicide must prevent HIV infection from entering both T-cells and LC,"" a NACO official said.,Women are physically more susceptible to HIV infection than men. Married women in developing countries are among those at highest risk due to their multi-partner husbands. Most new infections, about 14,000 every day, are in women.,According to WHO, 17.5 million women are living with HIV/AIDS, the worst affected being those aged 15-24 years, who are three to four times more likely to be infected with HIV than young men of the same age.

People who have genital herpes sores are more likely to be infected with HIV during intercourse. When they develop a sore, their immune system tries to heal it. ,If HIV in semen, vaginal fluid, or blood comes in contact with a herpes sore, the risk for infection is high. In the Africa study, 140 women from Burkina Faso, who were infected with both the herpes and AIDS viruses, received either Valacyclovir or dummy pills for three months. ,Those on the drug had less HIV in the bloodstream, with their count dropping from an average 20,000 virus copies per mm of blood to 8,000 copies. The placebo group saw their HIV levels shoot up from an average of 50,000 virus copies per mm of blood to 63,000.,The group on medication was also found to have less HIV in their genital tract 13% compared with 27% in the placebo group. The use of Valacyclovir also cut down the amount of time HIV was highly present and active in the genital tract by 59%. ,Reacting to the study, Dr Suniti Solomon from YRG Care told TOI from Chennai, ""Because genital herpes is so common in India among sex workers and HIV infected women, we have been using a cheaper herpes antiviral called Acyclovir 400 mg three times a day for 10 days on initial patients and 800 mg two times a day for 15 days in advanced patients."""

""It is important for us to be informed and educated about the virus. ,Thus empowered, we take on our relationships, families and work with a positive approach,""he said. ""It is only when we are properly informed and begin to take decisions for ourselves that we can become leaders,""said Danny, who is set to begin a one-ofits-kind leadership programme for HIV positive people in the UK from April 2 this year. ,He said that unlike in the UK, the fight against HIV/AIDS here is still in its early days. ,""The major challenges here are the taboos that HIV raises — sex, sexuality, drugs and death. This is what makes tackling HIV incidence a difficult situation. But people here can use this as an opportunity to talk openly about these issues and understand them."",Pointing out the silver lining, he said, ""In the UK, HIV/AIDS is considered a predominantly gay, drug abusers' and, now, African affliction. The public is considered almost impervious to the virus. Hence, there are no national campaigns against HIV there. In that way, India is better."",Danny, a gay himself, who has been on anti-retroviral therapy only for the last five years, stressed on adopting a positive attitude towards life in order to beat the virus. ,""You have to take care of yourself, eat a healthy diet, exercise, sleep well and laugh a lot,""he told his audience."

HIV/AIDS is not yet a general problem as it is confined to certain groups and geographical pockets,"" Mukesh Kapila, special representative of the Secretary General of the Geneva-based International Federation of Red Cross (IFRC), said.,Earlier, AIDS was perceived as part of an African problem. But now, it is a major cause of concern in Asia with India home to the second highest population of HIV-positive people, he said.,The IRCS, with guidance and cooperation from IFRC, has initiated upskilled HIV/AIDS programmes in the country.,""The young school and college-going population will come under the gambit of our programme. But we will have a targeted approach towards high-risk groups like truckers, sex workers and drug abusers,"" Kapila said.,The IRCS, under its Youth Peer Education scheme in six states -- Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh -- has been imparting training to youth to spread awareness about AIDS.,""We will double our capacity in terms of the number of clients and resources in the next couple of years,"" Kapila said on the sidelines of an international health meet in New Delhi.,Since the organisation's focus is on blood collection and donation, the IRCS has taken on the task of ensuring safe blood supply.,In India, nearly three to five per cent of HIV/AIDS is transmitted through blood transfers.

Jyoti died at AIIMS on March 26, two days before which her family was told that she was HIV positive and that further tests were required to find out the extent of the infection. Jyoti never got the time to undergo the tests.,When Jyoti was first admitted to AIIMS on September 28, 2006, she had severe diarrhoea later diagnosed as Crohn's Disease and a history of tuberculosis. Besides, her menstruation had stopped. ,Nine days later, while still under treatment for Crohn's, she was subjected to a bone densitometry test and found to weigh a dismal 18 kg. Her discharge summary dated the same day records how she had lost 12 kg in the past three years.,HIV-AIDS never figured in the doctors' diagnoses at that point she had not been tested. Jyoti was readmitted on November 2 with dengue. Two days later, she was asked to get an HIV test done. Though AIIMS on Wednesday claimed they were aware of her HIV status at that point, the discharge summary dated November 18 has no mention of it. ,This despite AIIMS spokesman Dr Shakti Gupta's assertions that as per the recommendations of the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, ""all patients who come to the hospital are treated as HIV+ as a precaution."",Says her brother, Yogesh, ""They never said a word about HIV during her dengue attack. When they told us four months later, we thought she had contracted the disease during that period through the 20-odd units of blood and platelets that she received."",Asked why the family was never informed about her HIV status in November, Dr Gupta said, ""It was just a suspicion, we needed the test reports to confirm it. They never collected the reports. Thus neither did the discharge summary mention HIV, nor was the family informed or counselled."",Yogesh, an illiterate auto driver, admits he did not collect the report. But, he says, ""At the time of discharge, nobody asked for the report either. I was never told how serious it was and we had assumed that if nobody has mentioned anything to us, the test must have been negative."",The whole course of Jyoti's treatment, meanwhile, has left AIDS experts shaking their head. Says Dr Pradeep Seth, formerly head of the department of microbiology at the institute who worked extensively on AIDS: ""Loss of weight, diarrhoea, history of TB these are all classical symptoms of full-blown AIDS. ,In fact, the government's awareness ads talk extensively of the same symptoms. It is very surprising that no HIV test was done during her first hospitalisation. In any case, the virus does not manifest itself in the tests before at least two-three years, so there is no way she could have contracted the infection in November."",Refuting AIIMS's claims of having known Jyoti's HIV status since November, Dr Seth said, ""Where then is the CD4 count report? They should have done it immediately. Why didn't they do the test to find out the viral load the girl had? Putting two and two together, AIDS should have been thought of in September itself which AIIMS obviously failed to recognise."",An under-pressure AIIMS on Wednesday issued a statement regarding Jyoti's case a statement with glaring loopholes that are exposed by Jyoti's medical records issued by AIIMS itself. ,The statement says Jyoti was first admitted to the hospital on November 2 with Crohn's Disease and later diagnosed with dengue, ignoring her first hospitalisation on September 28 and simply clubbing the two occasions. ,The statement claims she was diag-nosed as HIV positive on November 4 and the patient's attendant ""were advised to send the patients for post test counselling"", a claim Yogesh stoutly denies. The statement mentions an older TB infection in 2005-06 but makes no mention of her severe weight loss.,""We need to go through the records further to be able to see the complete picture,"" Dr Gupta said.,abantika.ghosh@timesgroup.com"

He is likely to be posted again in Gujarat, the sources said. ,The decision to reinstate him was taken after a special medical board set up by Director General A K Mitra, in a rare gesture, found him fit to resume duty. ,BSF officials hope the decision will instil a sense of confidence and hope among HIV-infected personnel in the force and prompt them to take a serious look at treatment. ,The BSF is already concerned at the ""substantial"" number of HIV-infected personnel and has joined hands with the United Nations Development Programme to provide education and awareness to its men. ,The BSF has installed condom vending machines in all battalions and sought the assistance of counsellors to tackle the crisis. ,According to official figures, 94 cases of HIV have been reported in the force so far. Seventy per cent of BSF personnel are aged between 25 and 40 and stay away from their families for long periods. ,It is ""natural that biological compulsions drive them to commercial sex workers"", officials said. They said AIDS was still considered a social stigma and personnel were reluctant to undergo voluntary medical check-ups. ,Another risk was the possibility of enemies taking advantage of ""vulnerable"" young personnel by luring them into ""honey traps""."
"Apr 2, 2007, 22:54 IST",'Breastfeeding helps reduce HIV transmission chances',"NEW DELHI: HIV-positive mothers can significantly reduce the chances of their child becoming infected with the virus by exclusively breastfeeding their baby till it reaches six months of age. ,A landmark study by scientists at the Africa Centre for Health and Population Studies, South Africa, has found that exclusive breastfeeding significantly reduces the risk of HIV transmission from mother to child in infants, compared to those also given solid foods or replacement feed like formula milk.,The research, published on Friday in 'The Lancet', has made some interesting findings. The researchers found that there is just 4% risk of post-natal transmission to infants solely fed on breast milk between the age of six weeks and six months of age.,Infants who received supplements like formula milk or animal milk in addition to breast milk were twice as likely to be infected as infants who received breast milk only.,However, children who were given solids in addition to breast milk, were almost 11 times more likely to acquire the infection.,Following these results, AIDS scientists are now calling for the United Nations guidelines to be changed to promote exclusive breast feeding by mothers in developing countries. At present, guidelines from Unicef and UNAIDS say the best option is to bottle-feed the babies with formula milk, where it is safe and hygienic to do so.,This study has serious implications for resource poor countries like India where 30% of the estimated 5.2 million strong HIV population are women. According to NACO, about 30% of the children born of HIV positive mothers end up having the infection. While 10% get it in the womb, an equal number get infected during delivery and breast feeding. Reacting to the study, NACO DG K Sujatha Rao told TOI, ""The study endorses what we practice in India. We encourage exclusive breast feeding of children by HIV positive mothers. Babies who are breast fed are protected against diarrhoea and pneumonia. Some African countries did try exclusive bottle feeding and recorded an increased child mortality due to HIV."",According to India's top HIV scientist Dr Suniti Solomon, there is 14% chances of the child getting infected with HIV by the mother's milk. ''A child deprived of mothers milk will anyway die of diarrhoea rather than HIV,'' she said. She added, ''Breastfeeding does carry with it a risk of transmitting HIV infection from mother to child, but it still remains a key intervention to reduce mortality. In India where poverty is endemic, replacement feed, such as formula milk or animal milk, is expensive and cannot act as a complete substitute.'',The African scientists cite a biological reason that might explain their latest findings.,The study, that involved around 2,700 babies born between 2001 and 2005, found that the death rate by three months of age for babies who were exclusively breast-fed was less than half that of infants who received infant formula alone.,Over 15% of babies whose HIV-infected mothers did not breast-feed them died by three months, compared with 6% of the babies whose mothers fed them exclusively. ,The study indicated that for women in impoverished countries where AIDS is prevalent, the health benefits of ,breast milk appeared to outweigh the risk of passing on HIV through breast-feeding. UNAIDS estimates that over 300,000 children are infected with HIV through breastfeeding every year.,Reacting to the study, UNAIDS chief in India Dr Dennis Broun told TOI, ""This research is a highly significant input but much more evidence is required for a formal recommendation to be made regarding exclusively breast feeding of children."""

We know that breastfeeding carries with it a risk of transmitting HIV infection from mother to child, but breastfeeding remains a key intervention to reduce mortality."" , "

A study, exploring the barriers to accessing care and treatment for HIV infected children in India, has found that most children are diagnosed for HIV when they are 30 months or older.,Carried out by Avina Sarna from the Population Council of India in collaboration with the Social Awareness Services Organisation (SASO), Asha Foundation and Freedom Foundation in three high prevalence states Manipur, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh, the study found that less than a fifth of children had been diagnosed with HIV infection before 18 months of age.,The largest proportion had been tested between 30 and 60 months while a fifth had been tested between 19-30 months and the remainder after 60 months. Sarna told TOI that annually, 27 million children are born in India of which 80,000 are infected with HIV. ,""We, therefore, initiated a study between June and December 2006 that interviewed 91 caregivers of children under 12 years of age who were taking ART and 117 caregivers of children under 12 years of age not taking ART. ,Late testing also means delayed initiation of co-trimoxazole prophylaxis which prevents life threatening opportunistic infections in infancy. Testing in early childhood programmes such as immunisation services, MCH clinics and well baby clinics needs to be explored,"" she said.,According to the study, most HIV tests on children were carried out after the positive status of their parents came to the fore. Less than a fifth of the children had been told of their HIV status. The most common reasons cited for not disclosing the HIV status to children were societal stigma and a fear that the child would tell others in the community.,Conducted to also assess the current level of adherence to ART among children receiving treatment, the study found that overall adherence to treatment was high. Only 44% of caregivers reported never missing any doses of medications ever. Just over a third of the caregivers could correctly identify all four routes of HIV transmission. Some caregivers mentioned mosquito bites, medications and eating food outside as possible routes of transmission.,Nearly half the caregivers reported difficulties in administering medications to children in their care. The three most commonly cited problems were the child's refusal to take medications, breaking tablets to get the correct dose as paediatric formulations are not available and children spitting out medications due to bad taste.,Meanwhile, Naco is expanding India's paediatric HIV programme. It is procuring 19 Qualitative Polymerase Chain Reaction machines (PCR), the only diagnostic tool that accurately detects the presence of HIV in children aged below 13.,kounteya.sinha@timesgroup.com"

What makes HIV special and dangerous is that it is quite good at adapting resistance to drugs. ,Many of the virus surface proteins — natural targets for inhibitory drugs — mutate at a very fast face. ,""The findings reveal a new target for inhibiting HIV that remains fully active against viral strains that are resistant to other drugs. VIRIP may stall and control HIV-1 replication in infected individuals. This promises to be highly suitable for development of a new class of HIV-1 inhibitors targeting the highly conserved fusion protein,"" the researchers concluded. ,There are now over 20 different HIV drugs in use. But the treatments fall into one of four categories based on their modes of action. What's worse, a growing number of HIV strains are becoming drug resistant. ,HIV resistance to one drug can lead to resistance to other drugs in the same class. ,""The world needs a variety of drug classes because multi-drug resistant viruses are starting to show up more and more. In at least some industrialised countries, it is already a severe problem,"" said Frank Kirchhoff of the University of Ulm. ,According to latest WHO estimates, nearly 40 million people worldwide are living with HIV/AIDS. ,Close to 4 million people became infected with HIV in 2006, and the virus was responsible for about 3 million deaths last year alone. ,kounteya.sinha@timesgroup.com"

""We are positive about it. What is wrong with doctors advising patients to test for HIV?"" she asked. ""We can't stretch the confidentiality clause to the point that it affects the patient's health."" Indian patients reach hospitals too late for any help to be provided. ""Such a recommendation would only help us treat patients,"" she added.,While NACO now brainstorms on how to roll out the new recommendations and tackle the ethical issues, many public health experts in India are not sure about the mandate. ""We have to use such guidelines intelligently,"" says Dr R D Lele, who is credited with identifying and treating the first HIV-positive patient of India over 20 years ago. ""We only have to target sexually-active persons in the age group of 16 to 45 years, drug users and patients who have undergone blood transfusions,"" he says. ""What is the point of asking a 65-year-old patient with cough and cold to undergo the test?"",Moreover, as Dr Lele points out, if the test is offered routinely to all patients, there is a danger of false positives. ""The HIV test is known to give false positive in case of patients suffering from malaria or chronic liver disease."",In India, there also is the problem of stigma attached to the HIV diagnosis. In Africa, the attitude is different considering that the epidemic has wiped out tens of thousands in their productive age group. In the US, the government is trying to implement the Centers for Diseases Control recommendation for annual testing for people in the age group of 16-35 years.,But in Kolkata, the staff of the Calcutta Medical College Hospital refused to touch the body of a young AIDS patient who died there two days ago. The extent of stigma attached to the HIV\AIDS tag is still immense. ""A couple of months back, a pregnant woman died outside a government hospital in Indore. In Lucknow, a renal failure patient who was HIV-positive had to wait for 16 hours before activists could get him a hospital bed,"" pointed out HIV rights activist-writer Bobby Ramakant from Lucknow.,Experts recommend that India should first put in place the many checks advised in the WHO guidelines: counselling before and after the HIV tests, introduce universal precautions such as double gloves for doctors and medical staff treating HIV\AIDS patients, etc. ""We first have to work towards reducing the stigma towards HIV\AIDS in healthcare settings,"" says Ramakant.,Akila Shivdas from the Centre for Advocacy & Research (CFAR), which has been working in the field of HIV\AIDS advocacy, felt WHO's new recommendations are a sureshot prescription at normalising the epidemic. ""The WHO idea is that by not according HIV\AIDS a special category, the epidemic can be normalised. But this normalisation process can't begin from the top, it has to start from within the community,"" she advised.,She points out to Thursday's news about the emergence of new HIV\AIDS hotspots in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. ""We now have small towns and villages with 1% incidence of HIV in pregnant women. This is considered high. If the testing is made mandatory in such areas without the proper buildup, it can have a disastrous effect."",The WHO team agrees that the shift from voluntary testing to provider-driven testing is drastic. ""This is radical in the sense that things have to change,"" said WHO HIV/AIDS director Kevin De Cock.

But in numbers, the situation looks grave with nearly 1 out of 100 adults in the country being HIV-positive.,In Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, the task of raising awareness about HIV is especially difficult due to the high proportion of rural population and relatively low levels of literacy. In Bihar, nearly 90% of the population lives in villages. In Uttar Pradesh, the figure is 79%. A particular problem is the literacy levels of females in both states. In Bihar, only one-third of females were literate at the time of the 2001 Census, as were 42% in Uttar Pradesh.,Despite such obstacles, awareness of HIV, how it spreads and ways to avoid it have risen in both states, according to bilingual HIV statistical chartbooks on the situation of HIV/AIDS in India, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh brought out by the Population Foundation of India, New Delhi, and Population Reference Bureau (PRB), Washington DC. The books were released at a seminar organised on Saturday. According to the charts, testing for HIV prevalence at sentinel sites in Bihar and UP has shown that HIV infection is spreading in the states, although the overall level of prevalence appears to be low at present.,Women are the most vulnerable to AIDS and yet their knowledge of the deadly disease is abysmally low.

One of the main causes of concern is that about 87 per cent of the affected patients are not aware of their status, Tejaswi said and added that every person should get himself tested even if he/she are not susceptible to HIV. The number of ART centres should be increased for the benefit of the patients, as, at present, there are only two ART centres in Bihar, Tejaswi said.,HIV positive children are a cause of serious concern as most of them have inherited the disease from their parents. To reduce the number of such children, the programme, ""Prevention of Parent to Child transmission"", needs to be strengthened. The use of condoms should be popularised among people not only in cities, but also in rural areas, he added.,Quoting a survey report, Tejaswi said only 18 per cent of the rural women of the state have heard of the HIV/Aids. Areas like Muzaffarpur, Kishanganj and Purnia, which have high incidence of Aids, mostly among the migrant labourers, must be made aware of the preventive measures like use of condoms, he said.,Chief guest Dr Gopal Prasad Sinha appraised the work done by RATNEI for the cause of HIV positive and Aids patients.

They duly admitted me. But, then I told them that I am HIV+ and their attitude changed entirely. I was immediately segregated, and put in the septic labour room, where I have been the only patient since I arrived here.'' ,Abbas, a high school drop-out who spray-paints moulded sculptures for a living, dittoed this. He added that he was asked to buy several pairs of gloves from the market, besides a blade. Then, ''while the doctors stood by and issued instructions, I carried out my wife's delivery, petrified of doing anything wrong. I have three daughters, and now I have been blessed with a son.'' ,Abbas had fallen in love with the Hindu widow and mother of two daughters and married her 12 years ago. This is Sunita's fifth baby. While she is HIV+, Abbas claims to be ''perfectly healthy'' himself.,Asked why the doctors did not carry out the procedure themselves, he said, ''They said it requires a special suit in the case of an HIV+ person. That they had used up their only such suit in an earlier HIV+ delivery case. I do not really blame them now because they tell me HIV is very dangerous and spreads very easily.'' ,His wife had been diagnosed as HIV+ after a test was carried out on her when a throat infection refused to heal. That was five years ago. And, she was being treated at the medical college's oncology department. The college principal, Dr Deepti Bisht and the head of gynaecology, Dr Abhilasha Gupta, couldn't be contacted, despite repeated attempts. ,But, Meerut chief development officer, Ms Roshan Jacob, who was handed the preliminary probe, told TOI, ''There were apparently four PG medical students, and a nurse and an ayah, in attendance. The medical college claims the medical staff carried out the delivery. The woman disputes it. There's a question mark on what really transpired.'' ,But, Jacob admitted that things were quite out of place. ''For instance, patients' attendants should not have to buy gloves or blades or other items themselves. ,The doctor on duty in the ward did not come for the delivery. Proper facilities were not available in the septic labour room. And, worst of all, the entire staff showed a deplorable insensitivity in a case demanding care and compassion. ,Also, there was no coordination between different departments, or the labour war-d would earlier have known the mother's HIV status.'' ,On July 28 last year, TOI had carried a report of a terminal HIV+ patient having been tied to his bed in the medical college. He died days later. ,State Health Minister Lalji Verma assured prompt and just action. ''If the incident is true, the guilty will not be spared,'' he declared. However, the Naco probe team has a different take on the events. ,Team member Bachani said Sunita, who has been on ART treatment for HIV in the same hospital, was transferred from a general labour ward to a septic labour room meant for patients of infectious diseases like Hep B, C and HIV after her HIV status became public. ,This led Abbas to believe that they were being discriminated upon.,Bachani added,"" After he made the allegations, we interrogated Abbas who kept changing his name to Sonu, making us a little suspicious. After several hours of inquiry, he finally admitted that he did not deliver the child. Initially he had said he had assisted the doctors. But when probed further, he could not recall how a delivery was conducted. Abbas has now given us a written statement confirming this.'' ,According to Naco, Abbas has formally withdrawn his complaint against the doctors and the child has been put on Neviripine - a prophylactic treatment to stop mother-to-child transmission of HIV.

And once recruited, you could also be subjected to random alcohol testing. Players in the BPO industry, which has a large youth employee base, are considering HIV/AIDS tests as part of the recruitment process. ,No final decision has been taken. ���A few BPOs have approached me informally and asked if they could introduce HIV/AIDS testing for employees. They also discussed testing employees for alcohol which makes sense as liquor affects employee performance,��� Nasscom president Kiran Karnik told ET.,Asked about the rationale for considering HIV/ AIDS testing, Mr Karnik said, ���It���s a changing world. The point of all medical tests is to find out if a person is, in any way, unfit for the job. It is individual company policy as to what tests are conducted. As far as Nasscom's policies go, we have a Nasscom Foundation that disseminates information on non-discriminatory HIV/AIDS policies at the workplace.���,It is learnt that a leading Gurgaon-based BPO has told its senior executives that such tests are in the offing. When contacted, the company spokesperson refused to confirm it but said, ���There are many Gurgaon-based BPOs that have had trouble with employees turning up drunk at work. These companies are looking at testing employees for alcohol.��� Given the sensitivities attached to HIV/AIDS testing, it remains to be seen whether BPOs, or anyone else for that matter, can make such testing compulsory. ,Terming HIV/AIDS testing as ���discriminatory���, Business Process Industry Association of India president Sam Chopra said, ���I���d support the alcohol-testing measure. There is currently an understanding that the security personnel would bar inebriated employees from entering the premises.��� It���s not known whether BPOs are considering testing employees for alcohol on a random or regular basis. Companies that ET spoke to said they haven���t faced any case of intoxicated employees or liquor consumption in the workplace but pointed towards ���others��� in the fraternity hit by the bottle. ,Recently, a Faridabad-based BPO employee, killed two children and injured four others in south Delhi allegedly under the influence of alcohol. Another leading Hyderabad-based BPO said the idea was interesting but was not being considered by the firm.,���Most employers have best practices which include prohibition of alcohol consumption in the office premises. If the employee manual makes it clear that an employee can���t be found intoxicated in office or consuming liquor, the employer is entitled to test the employee,��� says Nasscom vice-president Ameet Nivsarkar. According to Nasscom projections, IT-enabled services firms and BPOs together had about 5.5 lakh people on their payrolls in fiscal 2006-07."

The 23-year old woman, Rama (name changed), also claims to be the only HIV positive person in the entire world to attend this seminar held on June 4 and 5. The delegates from participating countries had assured to bring an infected person along, but it was only from India that Rama attended the seminar as a patient herself. Unfortunately, she was not able to make the presentation in the meeting as her flight was delayed and by the time she could make it to the venue, the time slot allotted to her was over.,The meet—ASEM workshop on HIV/AIDS—was organised by Asia Europe Meeting (ASEM). This is an international forum with members from the European Union and ASEAN, and takes up various issues like AIDS.,Her trip was sponsored by MAMATA another organisation working for HIV patients. ""What's worse, the mother of one was facing several other problems too. Her plight as well as the confidence she has got contributed to her selection for the seminar,"" said Aasha (name changed), who is also HIV positive. Both of them are members of Sanjeevani, a city-based organisation started by HIV positive persons. ,When contacted, Rama said though she could not make the presentation the seminar exposed her to a whole new world. A gesture by a woman photographer in the seminar deeply moved her. ""It was shivering cold. Though she knew that I am an HIV positive person, the photographer took off her coat and made me wear it. This is one gesture which I would have, probably, not experienced back home,"" she said. ,Back in India, Rama plans to implement the Swedish approach to tackling the disease. According to this approach, if a person is found infected, then the doctors track down all his partners to find out if others have been infected too.

""The tendencies of hiding facts are often proved to be fatalistic but still people tend to do such things in the society risking lives,"" she said. ,Attached to NKP Salve Institute of Medical Science, Dr Sunita Ghike feels otherwise.

The company has also tied up with 1,800 hospitals and labs where it will conduct the CD-4 test of HIV patients seeking insurance cover. ,The CD-4 count test is used to gauge immunity levels of an HIV-infected patient and to assess whether damage caused by the virus requires life-saving anti-retroviral therapy (ART). ,The CD-4 count is used in combination with the viral load test which measures level of HIV in blood. The test is ordered when a person is first diagnosed with HIV as part of a baseline measurement. Tests are repeated every six months. The CD-4 count in healthy adults ranges from 500 to 1,500 cells per cubic millimetre of blood.,In HIV infected people, it goes down by 60 cells per cubic millimetre of blood per year as HIV progresses. ART is administered when an HIV-positive person registers a CD-4 count under 200. Speaking to TOI, chief of Star Health V Jagannathan said, ""At present, we have fixed the premium at Rs 3,000. However, we plan to revise that and lower the price in the next renewal."",He added, ""This health insurance cover is awaiting Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority approvals. We hope to get them by this weekend. All that a patient has to do is come to us for the insurance cover. The blood tests will be conducted by us."" According to Naco, of the 2.5 million people with HIV in India, nearly 3 lakh at present suffer from full blown AIDS.,Reacting to this move, K K Abraham, chief of Indian Network of People Living with HIV, told TOI, ""For someone with CD-4 count above 500 following proper treatment regimen and good nutrition, transmission from HIV to AIDS will take nearly 15-16 years. The company, therefore, has done good research. However, that such an insurance cover is being launched at all is a great sign for India's HIV population. At present, no such cover exists. Hopefully, many other companies will come up with similar schemes for HIV-positive people."",Currently, AIDS insurance is not offered in India and insurers have complained that lack of representative data has kept them from venturing into the segment. Globally, the government of Uganda was the first to offer AIDS insurance to 25,000 miners. Star Health had recently come out with a Diabetes safe insurance policy. It covered already known diabetics against risks arising out of specified complications. The policy cover ranged from Rs 50,000 to Rs 4 lakh."

In the worst case scenario, the economic effects are observed in greater absenteeism and staff turnover, higher recruitment and training costs, and higher costs in medical care or insurance coverage, and retirement funds. ,""Even in countries with overall low HIV prevalence, such as India, the mere cost of treating people living with HIV and AIDS will be a huge economic and social burden to society.

The tiny survivor is now a star, with numerous childless couples queuing up to adopt her. Noida industrialist and social worker Sonia Kohli, who runs an NGO called Sahyog and in whose custody the Noida city magistrate has placed Chhoti, was inundated with requests to adopt the little girl on Saturday. This followed the airing of the news that Chhoti had been declared completely HIV free. ,What is heart-warming, however, is that, many of the couples volunteered to adopt Chhoti even when she had not been declared HIV free, according to Sonia Kohli."" They were willing to pay for her treatment and stand by her in every way,"" said Kohli. ""This time though, we will ensure that she gets responsible parents. Moreover, she is going to be properly and legally adopted."" ,Meanwhile, Mala Sarin, wife of Ghaziabad medical representative Neeraj Sarin, who had allegedly taken Chhoti away from rickshaw puller Mintu Gupta, is not happy. Neeraj Sarin told Times City, ""My wife has become extremely emotionally unstable after we returned the little girl. She is getting treatment from a Noida psychiatrist and we sometimes have to restrain her from running away somewhere. She has been bedridden ever since Chhoti was taken away. ,One cannot help loving that child but we had no choice. We wanted her to get the best possible help and treatment so we had to return her.

The West Bengal Board of Primary Education has, however, stood its ground and refused to give in to ,the demand.,The incident is a virtual repeat of an episode in a remote Kerala village, where HIV-positive children were ostracised by parents and their wards last year. ,The vicious whisper campaign against the children was started about a fortnight ago by a local goon at Gobindapur village, 25 km from Kolkata. He incited some villagers into demanding the ouster of the students. These 'HIV-positive' students are residents of a home run by an NGO.,Things came to a head about a week ago, when some parents submitted a signed memorandum to the school authorities, demanding that the HIV-positive children be removed. ,""We cannot allow our wards to study with HIV-positive kids. They are a threat and will infect our children. The school must throw them out, failing which we will withdraw our children,"" the letter to the headmaster stated.,One of the signatories to the memorandum, Sikha Ghosh, acknowledged she had no idea what HIV-positive or AIDS meant — except that it was a dreaded disease that everyone should guard against. ""I was told that my child would contract the disease if she came in contact with the affected children,"" she said.,Another parent, Ila-ub-Mollah, insisted he would withdraw his son if HIV-positive children continued to study in the school. ""I don't want to take any risks,"" he said.,The irrational demand, fuelled by ignorance and mischief, is similar to the ostracisation campaign that had rocked a primary school in Pampady district in Kerala. In December, parents put pressure on school authorities to oust five HIV-positive children. A subsequent outcry from NGOs had forced the school to re-admit the children.,The school authorities in Baruipur, too, were faced with a dilemma and approached the primary education board. The latter saved the day with a tough stance. ,""Making such a demand is dangerous. It is a result of ignorance. That HIV is not contagious is not known to those making the outcry. We will try to explain the facts to them. If they still remain adamant, the administration will step in. No student will be removed from the school at any cost. We have to rise to this challenge,"" said board chairman Ashok Bandyopadhyay.,Local CPM MLA said the issue had been stoked by a handful.

Though rumoured to be HIV positive, many couples on hearing about her through the media, volunteered to adopt her. ,However, not many are as lucky as her. Most people don't come forward to adopt HIV positive children. Recently, an HIV positive woman in Chhattisgarh, driven by poverty, offered her newborn daughter for sale. But no one wanted the baby as she too was infected. Later, the local administration, which got to know about the issue, stopped her from selling the baby and made arrangements for her treatment. ,Says Sonia Kohli, who runs Sahyog, an NGO, and in whose custody Chhoti was, ""Since the news was out in the media, people initially came forward to adopt Chhoti. When the hype died, people backed off. Even some doctors advised me against keeping the child. I have now given the child to a family, but I am sure that if Chhoti was HIV positive, nobody would have legally adopted her."" ,Arun Dave, president, AIDS prevention club, Rajkot, corroborates, ""Ever since we started working for the cause of AIDS, 18 years back, not even one family has volunteered to adopt an HIV positive child."" ,In many cases, even when the child turns out to be negative later, people are scared to adopt. HIV positive children turn negative only until they are one-and-a-half years old. After that, it's believed their status doesn't change. But medical miracles do happen. Anyhow, adoption agencies have a definite role to play here — in convincing the families and educating them about the issue. ""If we have a child who is HIV positive-turned-negative, we tell the family about the child. After counselling and making them understand the medical aspects, if they are still willing, they accept the child. However, this happens only once in a blue moon,"" says Madhavi Hegde Karandikar, adoption practitioner, Bal Asha, Mumbai. ,Such children are mostly adopted, either by rich parents and those settled abroad or foreigners. ""Adopting an HIV positive child requires a lot of willpower. Moreover, social acceptance of such children is less in our country. Outside India, people are more educated about HIV,"" says Nilima Mehta, chairperson, Child Welfare Committee, Mumbai. ,""There is a social stigma attached to it. Even today, there is not much awareness about HIV. Not many even know the difference between HIV positive and AIDS. They are ignorant about how HIV is passed and so don't want their families and friends to know that the child was born with the virus,"" says Dave. ,Outside India, there are many organisations which have been successful in placing HIV positive children in permanent and foster homes. One such project is Children With AIDS Project of America, which seeks out adoptive parents for HIV infants and children. Its database has over 1,000 waiting families. ,Experts say there are no legal restrictions for adoption of HIV positive children. ""We can give such children in adoption, provided there are families willing to take them and all documents are in place,"" says Wendy Andrews, adoption officer, Hope Foundation, New Delhi. Despite various measures taken by the government, people suffering from the disease still face stigma and isolation. A UNAIDS report claimed in 2006 that India had the largest number of people living with HIV/AIDS, an estimated 5.7 million. ,""Adopting a child involves knowledge within oneself that all children are equal, be they healthy or with special needs and therefore equally deserve security within a family. One should be better informed about the subject and make a choice knowing and understanding all these aspects,"" says Aloma Lobo, chairperson, IYC Community Centre, Bangalore. ,shanthi.selvarajan@timesgroup.com"

The West Bengal Primary Education Board has so far refused to accept the demand. But much of the credit for this goes to Mitali Biswas.,Mitali, the mother of an eight-year-old-girl who studies in Class III of the same school, was the first to bring the matter to the notice of the school authorities.

One day she drank water from the same glass that her HIV-positive friend had used. Some senior students who saw this went to her and asked her why she drank from the same glass. They scared her that she would also contract the dreaded HIV. That day she came home crying and told me the entire incident,""said Mitali. ,The next day Mitali went to the school and told one of the teachers how students were being discriminated. ,""The students cannot be blamed. They had probably heard all this from their parents and were repeating it,""says Mitali. ,She herself never felt anything wrong with her daughter befriending an HIV-positive girl. ""I have heard about the AIDS awareness campaign and even participated in some of the sessions organised by Unicef. It is surprising that many who people attended these sessions are still not convinced and are blind with superstition,""she said. ,What she says is true.

Talking to TOI, Manoj Parmar, an HIV positive, who has a family, said, ""I tell them that my life is as uncertain or certain as a normal person's is.

HIV positive persons should be guaranteed equal rights to education and employment like others in society."",Solicitor-general Goolam E Vahanvati, finding the two positions radically different, requested a Bench comprising Justices S H Kapadia and B Sudershan Reddy to decide the issue on merit.,The court had sought the help of the SG and the responses of the ministries on a petition filed by Andhra Pradesh government challenging a High Court order quashing the state's decision to deny promotion to an HIV positive constable to the post of sub-inspector. ,The home ministry said when slight deformities like squint or flat footedness were a disqualification for joining Central police forces, it would be absurd to recruit an HIV positive person.,""The HIV/AIDS affected person, whose immunity system is severely compromised, would not be able to withstand the rigours of training and highly strenuous deployment under adverse conditions on the borders or in militancy affected areas,"" it said.,Immuno-compromised person may not be able to give his 100% in the high-risk operations tasked to Central police forces .,""Jawans lead a community life in bunkers, barracks and so on with a common barber, a common paramedic etc. The work of Central police forces is such that cuts, bruises, injuries and bleeding wounds are not uncommon,"" it said, arguing against the health ministry's stand that strict confidentiality should be maintained about the HIV status of a person.,It said, ""In most cases, those who respond to wounded personnel are his colleagues who are not medically trained.

"Nov 2, 2007, 02:02 IST",Estranged women turn HIV+,"HYDERABAD: So far, promiscuous men have been held largely responsible for fuelling the HIV epidemic in India, but HIV/Aids experts now say men alone cannot be blamed. ,Promiscuity among women is on the rise, they say, with an increasing number of women reporting to be HIV positive while the status of their spouses is negative.,Doctors working closely with HIV/Aids patients at government hospitals say they are seeing more HIV positive women among discordant couples (where one is positive and another negative). Statistics of such cases from state-run maternity hospitals in Hyderabad are perhaps not only a social indicator but also confirm the trend. ,""In discordant couples, women are HIV positive in around 30 per cent cases and the husbands are negative,"" says Dr G Shailaja, superintendent of the Government Maternity Hospital, Koti, who has been studying the issue closely.,These cases started coming to light over the past two to three years when expectant mothers started undergoing HIV tests. Dr Shailaja says such a high number of HIV positive women among discordant couples was ""unexpected."" The average age of the infected women is around 30 years.,Doctors also note that most women cite ""blood transfusion"" as the reason that led to the infection. Globally, 80 per cent of the women are infected with HIV through their spouses or life partners. ""But now we are told there are more reported cases of discordant couples with women positive and their partners negative,"" says K Padmavathi, deputy director of the Andhra Pradesh State Aids Control Society.,Those working in the field of HIV/Aids say such cases are not really city-specific. Doctors working with HIV/Aids cases for over a decade note that if earlier, the percentage of HIV positive men was 90 per cent (among couples who approached them), the percentage has dropped to 65 per cent now. ,""It may have dropped further,"" says Dr P Balamba, obstetrician and gynaecologist and former additional superintendent of Osmania General Hospital. ,She says the while the trend has been there for some time now, the numbers have started increasing only over the past few years.,Dispelling a myth before it takes form, Dr Balamba says the trend is not as prevalent among working women but is being reported from all walks of life across social classes. ,""From workers to the highly educated,"" she says, her observations based largely on her experience at the Government Maternity Hospital, Nayapul and now from her private practice. ,""Promiscuity is increasing among girls not just in urban but even in rural areas,"" she says, adding that perhaps this was being brushed under the carpet and is now coming forth with HIV statistics as the indicator.,Another gynaecologist, who did not wish to be named, said women were more susceptible to the infection (compared to men) given that the concentration of the virus is higher in semen. ,Interestingly, doctors observe that families and husbands in particular have been ""considerate and supportive"" of their HIV positive wives, but they point out this observation is not really applicable to the more educated class where some cases have ended in divorce. However, in most cases families have been supportive, doctors say."

""His family members hid the fact. Had we been aware we would not have gone ahead with the marriage,"" the inconsolable father said.,He added that Anand's family members had told them that he was working with a well-known mobile phone service provider and hence they did not find any reason to reject the marriage proposal.

"Nov 21, 2007, 00:55 IST",UN says it overstated HIV cases by 6.3 million,"NEW DELHI: The world now has 6.3 million fewer cases of people estimated to be living with HIV, thanks to India.,According to UNAIDS's latest estimates, there are 33.2 million people living with HIV worldwide. That's 16% less than the 39.5 million it estimated in 2006, clearly showing that the global burden of HIV till now was highly overstated.,Experts, however, said the revision of figures was primarily due to India and five other countries — Angola, Kenya, Mozambique, Nigeria and Zimbabwe — lowering their prevalence rates from the earlier high numbers.,In July 2006, India announced that there were 2.5 million people living with HIV/AIDS, about 2.7 million fewer cases than previously estimated. India's HIV prevalence figures in the general population also dipped to .36% against .9%, making India the third worst affected country with the deadly disease after South Africa (5.5 million) and Nigeria (2.9 million).,What made the difference was the methodology used by India in 2006 — the estimates, referred as ""closest to the truth"", was reached after studying the data from the country's 1,122 sentinel surveillance sites as against the 155 such sites in 1998. A massive sero-prevalence study, testing 1.5 lakh random blood samples from 29 states, also gave better insight into India's actual burden of HIV.,UNAIDS executive director Peter Piot said, ""The single biggest reason for the reduction in global HIV prevalence figures was the recent revision in India after an intensive reassessment of the epidemic in that country. These improved data presents us with a clearer picture of the AIDS epidemic, one that reveals both challenges and opportunities."",However, the revamped estimates still represent a massive human tragedy. AIDS remains the fourth biggest killer worldwide. Every day in 2007, more than 6,800 people were infected with HIV. Women made up half of those infected. Over 5,700 died from it everyday. An estimated 1.7 lakh people died of the disease in India alone last year.,""So many lives lost due to AIDS is not a matter of joke. What's worse, over two-thirds of those infected in India don't know they are HIV positive,"" Dr Dennis Broun, UNAIDS chief in India, told TOI.,Naco director-general K Sujatha Rao said, ""The statistical changes are a result of more accurate surveys all across the world. It's good news that the world has over 6 million fewer HIV cases."",Dr Broun added, ""It's nearly impossible to conduct NFHS III like surveys all over the world. Such surveys are high cost with NFHS III HIV study costing nearly $14 million. That's why we have first taken such surveys into account and then mathematical models to come up with new figures."" Two-thirds of new infections were recorded in sub-Saharan Africa in 2007. In Asia, there are now 4.9 million cases, up 440,000 from last year. The UN has also changed its estimate on how long it takes to die of AIDS if not treated from nine years to 11 years."

Maulana Azad Medical College (Delhi), PGI (Chandigarh) and ART centres in Kolkata, Manipur and Nagaland will introduce it by April 2008. Nearly 3,000 patients, who have become resistant to first-line therapy, will be put on second-line by December 2008.,Ten doctors from these centres are being sent to Thailand to study operational issues relating to second-line therapy in mid-December.,At present, the National Aids Control Programme only provides free first-line drugs to over 1.05 lakh HIV patients in its 127 ART centres. Naco estimates that at least 3% of these patients have become resistant to first-line drugs, thanks to poor adherence to the treatment regimen. If not put on second-line immediately, most of these patients would die within a few years. Health secretary Naresh Dayal said: ""We had planned to introduce second-line treatment only after one lakh HIV patients were put on first-line drugs. Now that we have crossed that mark, second-line will be introduced in January in a controlled manner. Only those patients, who have been on first-line drugs in Naco's ART centres and have become resistant, will be eligible for second-line."",Dayal said UNITAID, an international drug purchasing facility, has offered to donate the drugs to India for the first two years. Naco will then tie up with India's generic drug makers to provide them. A health ministry official said: ""Ramadoss is yet to decide whether we will accept UNITAID's donation or tie up with pharma companies from the start itself."" Under first-line therapy, patients had to consume two tablets a day. When on second-line, the number will increase to almost 10 with more side-effects. ,kounteya.sinha@timesgroup.com"

All because he was HIV positive.,Vignesh's isn't the only instance of stigmatisation in Tamil Nadu that is touted as the most ""successful state"" in India in the battle against AIDS. Indeed, Tamil Nadu's experiment with sex education in schools has gone a long way towards increasing AIDS awareness. But this hasn't stopped the denigration of HIV positive people — the situation in this regard in Tamil Nadu is as bad.,Prabha Priya's (name changed) children were thro-wn out of school three months ago after the teacher discovered she was HIV positive.

In all this, it's the three-year-old Vignesh's story that is the most heart-rending.

More than 90% of those infections are acquired through sexual intercourse.,Infection with HIV occurs by the transfer of blood, semen, vaginal fluid, pre-ejaculate, or breast milk. Within these bodily fluids, HIV is present as both free virus particles and virus within infected immune cells. The four major routes of transmission are unprotected sexual intercourse, contaminated needles, and transmission from an infected mother to her baby at birth, or through breast milk. ,Screening of blood products for HIV in the developed world has largely eliminated transmission through blood transfusions or infected blood products in these countries.

Instead, when Harsha sat on the dental chair of a trust-run hospital for tooth extraction she told the dentist that she was HIV positive.,The truth stung. The dentist refused to treat her saying the proper equipment was unavailable and sent her to Civil Hospital. The story there was quite the same for Harsha, a teacher in a school in Saraspur.,Harsha's is a shocking case that speaks volumes about the stigma that the society still holds for HIV patients. She is among those who was being cajoled by HIV activists to reveal her HIV status to her neighbours and live a more free life.,Harsha contracted AIDS from her husband who is a diamond worker. Her first experiment with truth went horribly wrong when after suffering tooth pain for some days, Harsha went to Maniben Hospital in Saraspur. ,""There a lady dentist took my X-ray and advised me to get two teeth removed. I could have easily gone ahead but my conscience did not allow me to hide my infection and risk other people's lives,"" said Harsha. When Harsha disclosed her HIV positive status, the doctor appreciated her for being honest ""but declined me treatment saying she did not have disposable equipment and asked me to go to Civil Hospital. Now, what would have happened if I had just kept mum?"",At Civil Hospital, the doctor agreed to treat her but only after she bought an AIDS kit which costs between Rs 250-300, which Harsha can ill-afford. ""At Civil Hospital, too, the doctor was about to begin my treatment when I spoke the truth,"" rues Harsha. ,Meanwhile, Jitendra Maharaj of Ahmedabad Network of Positive People told TOI that Harsha's failed experiment with truth just goes on to prove that despite there being so much awareness about HIV-AIDS, patients are discriminated against.,""Most of the HIV patients do not disclose their status and may be indirectly exposing healthy people to a risk.

Nagesh is HIV-positive and didn't want Reema to get infected ever.,The couple, who only want to be identified as residents of a big southern city, began visiting doctors and, of course, countless websites. They soon found an answer - assisted reproductive techniques (ART) better known as infertility treatment. ""I found out after an intensive Google search that we could have a healthy baby using an ART procedure called ICSI,"" reveals Nagesh.,After some infertility experts refused to take up their case, they flew down to Mumbai to meet Anjali and Aniruddha Malpani who had agreed on email to help them.,""Many people don't know that it is possible and extremely safe for HIV-discordant couples (one person is HIV positive but the other is not) to have HIV-negative babies using ART,"" says Anjali Malpani, who has helped four discordant couples conceive in the last one year.,Her husband, Aniruddha, points out that ART for HIV discordant couples is an established medical protocol. ""Two medical journals, ,Lancet, and ,New England Journal of Medicine,, carried exhaustive studies highlighting this over five years back establishing a treatment protocol for HIV-discordant couples,"" says Aniruddha.,Rahul and Sapna are another HIV-discordant couple who approached the Malpanis for medical assistance. The 26-year-old husband and 24-year-old wife are now proud parents of a baby girl. ,""A baby is one of the natural urges in human beings,"" says Rahul, who got infected while trying to help an accident victim. ""I and my wife always loved babies and so we also wanted one for ourselves. More importantly, we wanted the child to be a part of both of us,"" he says in an email interview.,In medical terms, the HIV-affected man's sperms are put through a ""wash"" for the IVF treatment. The density gradient sperm wash, which is conducted in a centrifuge machine, continues for almost 60 minutes and separates the sperms and other cells and waste in the semen. The live sperms are once again tested for HIV before being transferred to the woman in a procedure called the intra-uterine transfer.,""However, to be extra cautious, we use a technique called ICSI or an intracytoplasmic sperm injection to ensure that both the child and mother won't be exposed to HIV,"" says Aniruddha. ICSI involves injecting the sperm into the inner part (or cytoplasm) of the woman's egg in a laboratory, explains Anjali.,According to Lilavati Hospital's infertility expert Nandita Palshetkar, ""Given the improved treatment and medications for HIV as well as IVF technologies, healthy pregnancy and babies can be a reality for HIV-discordant couples."",While the US bans transfers of any tissues or organs from HIV-positive persons and puts a question mark on such pregnancies, it is carried out in Europe. In fact, a peer-reviewed medical journal, AIDS 2007, recently advocated the wider use of IVF techniques for HIV-discordant couples.,The article, submitted by scientists from the University of Toulouse, France, states, ""It is neither ethically nor legally justifiable to exclude individuals from infertility services on the basis of male HIV-infection. For many countries in the world, the first priority of the policy against HIV is to improve education, to allow access to HIV screening, to encourage condom use and to offer antiretroviral therapy where appropriate. In countries where these approaches are now in place we recommended that assisted reproductive programmes, such as IUI with sperm washing, should be integrated into a global public health initiative against HIV."",Rahul and Sapna, who began enjoying the joys of parenthood a few months back, couldn't agree more.

Now, the National Aids Control Organisation (Naco) has some more good news.,The prices of first-line anti-retroviral therapy (ART) drugs, the only known treatment that suppresses the HIV virus and that was available to Indian patients till now, has dipped.,Till now, Naco paid Rs 7,000 to purchase drugs for every patient on treatment every year. Over 1.3 lakh HIV patients are on ART at present who get it free from any government-run ART centre.,TOI has learnt that according to the latest tender, announced and opened for bidding on December 5 and then finalized by Naco, a generic drug making Indian company will supply the same drugs for Rs 2,000 less.,Confirming this, Naco director-general K Sujatha Rao told TOI: ""This is great news for the programme. At present, we have 1.3 lakh people on ART. The price cut will help us in putting many more patients on ART. Our target is to reach 1.75 lakh HIV patients by March 2009."",Though Rao did not disclose the name of the company which had won the bid, she said the company would start supplying the drugs to Naco from February 2008.,India uses two-drug and three-drug combinations under the ART programme. Drugs like Stavudine, Lamivudine, Nevirapine, Efavirenz and Zidavudin are given in combination to decrease resistance among HIV positive patients. At present, seven Indian companies make generic first-line ART drugs. Naco spent Rs 60 crore on just procuring drugs in 2006.,A health ministry official said: ""Competition among pharma companies has been steadily bringing down the price of generic ART drugs. When Naco started ART in April 2004, it cost the government Rs 10,000 for drugs per person per year. In 2005, it became Rs 8,000 and in 2006, it dipped by Rs 1,000 more. Now it's become Rs 5,000."",Meanwhile, India is all set to roll out second-line ART to over 3,000 HIV patients from January in two centres — Mumbai's J J Hospital and Chennai's Tambaram ART centre. These patients were facing imminent death because they had become resistant to the first-line treatment, thanks to poor adherence to the treatment regimen.,Second-line therapy is expensive — it will cost Naco Rs 8,000 per patient on ART per month. Clinton Foundation will provide the drugs for free to Naco for the next two years. The foundation will in turn get the drugs from UNITAID, an international drug purchasing facility.,Ten doctors from Delhi, Mumbai and Chennai have just returned from Thailand after being trained on operational issues relating to second-line therapy.

"Rema Nagarajan,Dec 23, 2007, 00:22 IST","Real victims: HIV widows, orphans","HIV widow K Ramadevi ,(TOI Photo),Over 12 years after their marriage, 27-year-old K Ramadevi's husband died in September last year of AIDS, leaving her to fend for herself and her two sons. Soon afterwards, she found that she too was HIV+. This is a story repeated by thousands of women across Andhra Pradesh. They are a growing tribe referred to as ""HIV widows"", most of them HIV+ themselves. Some are lucky that their children escaped being infected. ,Ramadevi's children can consider themselves luckier than some who have lost both parents to AIDS. Talking to scores of AIDS-affected people gathered at an annual meet organised by Andhra Pradesh AIDS Control Society (APSACS) in Hyderabad, what comes across all too clearly is that the victims are often not the ones succumbing to the disease.,""My husband started drinking, smoking and visiting other women. When I tried to dissuade him, he refused to change, saying I could leave if I could not take his behaviour. I tried to persuade him to go in for an HIV test which too he refused,"" laments Ramadevi. Two years back, he found he was positive but hid the fact from her. After he died, Ramadevi found she too was HIV+. The counsellor at the testing centre reassured her that she could live a good life as long as she ate nutritious food and took care of herself. ,An NGO that works with HIV+ people offered to train her as an outreach worker. ""The NGO staff pointed out that I had to fend for my children. And so I took up the job despite opposition (from villagers) and started working from April this year,"" says Ramadevi. ,She visits the villages in Jangareddygudem mandal and finds out from anganwadi workers and registered medical practitioners about people in the village who have been falling ill frequently. ""I encourage such people to get themselves tested and assure them that the government could help them get treatment. Sometimes to convince them, I reveal that I am also HIV+ and convince them to join the local network of HIV+ people. So far, I have convinced 40 people,"" she says.,There are many others like her. Visamshetty Lakshmi from Krishna district is HIV+. After her husband died in February 2004, a year after testing positive, she found that she too had been infected, though her 10-year-old son is not. She now works as an outreach worker for an NGO that helps ensure that she gets the drugs for her treatment free of cost. ""I have suffered due to lack of awareness. Now I want to spread awareness about HIV to the remotest corners. My team has managed to get as many as 400 HIV+ people into the network since 2005,"" say Lakshmi proudly. ,Vadali Kanakadurga, B Vijayakumari, Sri Lakshmi - the list of HIV widows could go on and on. There are no recriminations or anger. Just a desperate hope to live as long as possible for the sake of their children and a strong desire to help as many people as possible from falling prey to the disease. ,Though lucky enough to escape the virus, many children have been orphaned. After the parents of 10-year-old Shiva from Dharmapuram died five years back, he and his elder brother had no one except their old grandmother, who was too old to even take care of herself. ,The Rural Development Trust (RDT), an NGO working in Anantapur district, came forward to foot the bill for putting the two children in a hostel and paying their school fees. Desperately lonely, Shiva often takes a bus on his own from his hostel in Dharmapuram 35 km away, to Bathalapalli, where RDT runs a hospital for people with HIV/AIDS, to meet his favourite person, Father B Sirrappa. ,""The bus ride is free for me because I am less than 12 years old. I come here to see father,"" whispers Shiva. As the sun sets, he trudges out of the hospital, weighed down with rations for his grandmother provided by RDT and takes the bus for the long ride home.,There are hundreds of Shivas across the state. AP has a growing number of children orphaned by AIDS. In most cases, relatives and families are reluctant to look after them. Only about 100 such orphans have been accommodated in four orphanages. ""I am opposed to the idea of separate orphanages for children affected by HIV or AIDS. The state should have common orphanages for all children who need care and support,"" says G Asok Kumar, project director of APSACS. ,Andhra also has over 7,000 children identified as being infected or affected by HIV. Of these, nearly 1,500 are on anti-retro viral drugs. Parents who are often too poor to afford the care and treatment have abandoned many HIV+ children. The government estimates that in the next five years, there will be as many as 60,000 children who would be infected or affected by HIV and AIDS.,rema.nagarajan@timesgroup.com"
"Rema Nagarajan,Dec 26, 2007, 02:51 IST",Docs worst when it comes to HIV+ patients,"NEW DELHI: If ignorance breeds discrimination against people with HIV/AIDS, you would expect doctors to be least discriminating. However, HIV+ people across the country say that the worst discrimination they face is from doctors and health workers like nurses and paramedical staff.,The medical community itself does not deny this. Though HIV does not spread as easily as TB or hepatitis and though more people die of TB and cancer than AIDS, the stigma that leads to even doctors shunning HIV+ people is what makes the disease so dreadful. Otherwise, it is a disease like cancer that has no cure and which could eventually kill you just like a lot of other diseases, says Dr G Suresh Kumar who treats about 150 HIV+ people a day in the Rural Development Trust Care and Support Centre in Anantapur district of Andhra Pradesh. ,Indian Medical Association (IMA) secretary general Dr S N Mishra blames it on the irrational fear among doctors. No patient should be ignored or treated as untouchable. But some hospitals do not have the necessary facilities to treat these patients. That could also be the reason why they are turned away, says Mishra. ,Dr Lalit Duggal senior consultant, internal medicine, at Ganga Ram Hospital rubbishes this claim saying no extra facilities are needed to treat HIV+ people. If you can treat cough and cold, you can also treat people with HIV. If anything, it is the HIV patients who are more vulnerable to getting infections from us than the other way around, says Duggal. ,He adds that the precautions to be taken are precautions that need to be taken for any patient, such as wearing gloves, disposing of gloves and materials used on the patient in sodium hypochloride solution and so on. You would be surprised at the extent of ignorance among doctors about the disease, the modes of infection, treatment protocol and so on. They are even scared to touch the HIV+ person. Doctors and paramedical staff need more training. ,In a high prevalence state like Andhra Pradesh with an estimated HIV+ population of over five lakh, the situation has become so bad that the AP State AIDS Control Society has launched an initiative called the Bold Doctors Club. ,The APSACS project director, G Asok Kumar, has challenged dammunna doctorlu (doctors with guts) to become part of this club and come forward to show their willingness to treat people with HIV/AIDS. ,We have trained 5,000 doctors of our primary health centres and we have had many doctors from the private sector also coming forward. At least now, we have a list of doctors to whom people with HIV/AIDS can go with the confidence that they will be treated, explains Kumar. ,If K Ramesh Babu, president of the Telugu Network of People living with HIV/AIDS (TNP+) is to be believed, the initiative has yielded, at best, about three or four doctors per district who are willing to treat HIV+ people. Surgeons and gynaecologists are the worst. Many will perform only caesarian deliveries or just turn you away. Some doctors are willing to treat but will charge you three or four times more, says Babu, who has been living with HIV since 1996. ,Kumar says the greatest concern is gynaecologists refusing treatment to HIV+ persons. Mother to child transmission of HIV virus is the only transmission which is preventable through drugs. If every HIV+ mother is able to avail of medical services, we can almost completely put an end to children being born with HIV. Hence, this is our area of focus, says Kumar. Without treatment, around 15-30% of babies born to HIV positive women will become infected with HIV during pregnancy and delivery. ,A further 5-20% will become infected through breastfeeding. A single dose of the drug nevirapine given to the mother at the onset of labour and to the baby after delivery is said to bring down the chances of transmission considerably.,The million dollar question is why doctors, who after five and six years of medical education and who are supposed to be the most knowledgeable, discriminate the most. National AIDS Control Organisation (Naco) claims to do a lot of sensitisation and training of doctors. However, it is not just about information and awareness, it is all about changing attitudes and not much progress has happened there, says Loon Gante, president of Positive Peoples Network, Delhi.,rema.nagarajan@timesgroup.com"

A study conducted by AIIMS's clinical microbiology department has revealed shocking results — over 33% of those enrolled for the study, with both HIV and TB, were found to be suffering from XDR-TB. What's worse, all the patients with XDR-TB died within three months of diagnosis.,The study conducted by a three member team, headed by Dr Sarman Singh, head of the department of lab medicine, has been reported in the November issue of the international journal 'AIDS'.,Dr Singh told TOI, ""Fifty-four AIDS patients suspected of having HIV-tuberculosis co-infection were investigated in 2006 for the prevalence of XDR-TB. Out of them, TB was isolated from 24 (44.4%). Twelve (50%) of these had resistance to first-line drugs, whereas four (33.33%) were also resistant to second-line drugs."" He added, ""This is the largest study done in India with subjects being coinfected with HIV and TB. After isolating the TB culture, we tried for antibiotic sensitivity. This is the first time that XDR-TB has been found to infect HIV patients in India."",According to Dr Singh, XDR-TB is a grave public health threat. ""Officials of India's TB Control Programme must stop denying that XDR-TB exists in India,"" he said.,The study comes months after researchers from Hinduja National Hospital in Mumbai first found XDR-TB in 8% of all TB patients. The team had examined 3,904 lab samples and found 1,274 were positive for TB. Of these, 32% were multiple drug resistance (MDR-TB), of which 8% were XDR-TB cases. Mortality rate of XDR-TB patients in the study was as high as 42%. XDR-TB cases are those MDR-TB sufferers who are resistant to all known TB medicines. This occurs when a physician does not prescribe a proper treatment regimen or when a patient, who is already suffering from MDR-TB, does not complete his lengthy therapy.,However, India's National TB Control Programme has no data on the prevalence of XDR-TB. India, in fact, has just woken up to MDR-TB and doctors have started diagnosing and treating it in two labs in Gujarat and Maharashtra. After detecting MDR-TB, 50 people have been put on DOTS Plus treatment. Dr Saumya Swaminathan from TRC Chennai told TOI, ""We have received 1,200 TB samples from the lab in Gujarat of which 200 are MDR-TB. We are finding out how many of these are XDR to get an idea of its overall prevalence."",Dr Swaminathan, however, said the AIIMS and Hinduja figures could not be extrapolated. ""Both are tertiary referral hospitals getting the worst patients. Also, the AIIMS sample size is too small. The study being done in TRC Chennai, results of which will be out in February, will give a better idea of XDR-TB's prevalence in the country."",TB is the single largest killer of AIDS patients in India. Naco reveals that over 60% of all AIDS patients contract and ultimately die of TB. WHO's coordinator for TB/HIV and drug resistance programme Paul Nunn said, ""XDR-TB problem is relatively small in India right now. But the worrying thing is that it is there. India must prepare its defences immediately. If this XDR-TB strain mixes with HIV, the combination is explosive as it causes 100% mortality."",kounteya.sinha@timesgroup.com"

Chembur resident Saiba Sheikh (name changed to protect identity) who was advised an HIV test as part of her gynaecology treatment, was told to return after eight days as the kits were out of stock. Calls made to several ICTCs in the suburbs and the rest of Maharashtra yielded the same response.,The shortage began a fortnight ago. Doctors at ICTCs in major civic hospitals such as KEM, Sion and Nair hospitals received a notice from the Mumbai District AIDS Control Organisation (MDACS) on February 1, saying that ���there is an acute shortage of HIV-testing kits (rapid 1) which are supplied by National Aids Control Organisation (NACO)������. MDACS is the local body of NACO.,The notice further said that the centres should postpone collection of blood samples from people in view of the shortage.,""Such frequent non-availability of kits makes people lose faith in our centres.

Denying that all the centres had run out of stock, she said, ""We are in constant touch with NACO officials who are in the process of providing kits. We received some stock from them just 2-3 days ago, which we have distributed to centres.

He attributed the delay to ""administrative procedures"". Admitting that such a shortage should not arise, he said that the NACO had supplied 2 lakh interim kits all over the country, but the regular supply was likely to start by next week.,The current lapse comes close on the heels of a World Bank report released in December 2007, which revealed shocking findings of corrupt and fraudulent practices in the NACP-II. About test kits, the bank had questioned MDACS���s move to award contracts to a particular company, Monozyme, though the company���s bids were 'non-compliant with the contract's specifications'.

It provides a new tool for probing cellular, as well as viral, regulation, and for understanding how other biological decisions are made, notably how stem cells choose between different developmental fates, the researchers say. ,The researchers explored the genetic master circuit of HIV, the Tat circuit, and built upon previous work by Leor S. Weinberger, professor of chemistry and biochemistry at UC San Diego, which showed that it did not function like a standard on-off switch (a light switch, for example). ,Weinberger's previous work found that the HIV circuit is driven by cellular noise, or random events, which activate the circuit for a limited amount of time before it turns off."

The district police on Saturday arrested a 38-year-old HIV positive man, a relative of one of the girls, based on a complaint that he had raped the two girls and passed on the deadly virus to them. ,Police arrested Ayyappan, a mason, a day after the parents of the girls filed a complaint, and booked him under IPC 376 (rape) and 506 (1) (intimidation), district superintendent of police T Senthil Kumar told The Times of India over phone from Virudhunagar. ,Even two months ago, the district staff of the Tamil Nadu State AIDS Control Society (TANSACS) came to know that the two girls had been infected with HIV and suspected that Ayyappan could be the culprit. ""But we could not do anything without the parents cooperating with us,"" said a TANSACS staff, who did not want to be named.,Police said that Ayyappan, whose wife died a year ago after setting herself on fire, was a neighbour and relative of the unsuspecting girls, aged 12 and 15. Villagers say that the woman had killed herself after she came to know that her husband was HIV positive. ,The victims, both school dropouts, were friends of Ayyappan���s daughter and they used to frequent one another���s house. The accused must have raped the girls over a period of time until a year ago, police said. When the girls began to fall sick frequently, doctors at the government hospital took tests for HIV and both confirmed positive for HIV. Though the test was taken six months ago, the shattered parents kept it under wraps fearing social stigma and also harassment from Ayyappan, who was one of the girls��� uncle. ,They chose to lodge a complaint only on Friday night after much persuasion from a TANSACS official who was sent from Chennai to make enquiries about the allegation.,Ayyappan had apparently claimed that the girls were willing partners in the sexual act. ""We have to verify this with the girls. Anyway it still amounts to rape as the victims are minors,"" said Senthil Kumar.,Ayyappan also claimed to have known about his HIV status only two days ago when he took a test in the hospital. ,Taking a serious note of the incident, Tamil Nadu State AIDS Control Society (TANSACS) project director Supriya Sahu sent a team of officials to Srivilliputur for investigation and asked the district collector and the SP to take action."

For the first phase of the programme, the organisation has identified 10 grandmothers who take care of their orphaned HIV+ grandchildren. Most uncles, aunts, even brothers and sisters, are unwilling to take in HIV+ children, but CHES found grandmothers preferred caring for the children themselves.,""The biggest problem these grannies face is money.

Most came up with proposals for petty shops, idli kadais and fruit selling businesses. They are given Rs 3,000 and a social worker monitors their progress.,""We don���t tell them how to spend it, but we advise on re-investing to make the business grow. We would like them to become independent,"" says Joel. ,Apart from food and educational needs, most of the children require regular medical treatment, something the grannies can barely afford.

Police said Prakash Kumar (name changed), a driver of commercial vehicles, committed suicide by jumping from the seventh floor of the building. Kumar, whose wife and one son are also HIV positive, was suffering from depression, the cops added.,But the claim was disputed by Kumar's younger brother, Amit. ""He was absolutely fine. How can they call it suicide?"" he said. Kumar was diagnosed with a positive status four years ago.,For the Kumar family, it's a tragedy that's going to resonate through four lives: Prakash's wife, his two sons ��� the elder is HIV+ ��� and Amit, who claims Prakash is the only family he had. ""We are four brothers. But he was everything to me,"" he says.,Prakash drove rented vehicles carrying goods across the country. His 24-year-old wife, who along with his elder son, had also been found HIV+ after Prakash was discovered to have AIDS, is inconsolable. Amit claims the news of his brother's death is a complete shock. ,""He was fine till yesterday evening, when my sister-in-law went with his dinner. He had even asked her to make bhindi the next day. Now the hospital says he jumped from the bathroom window of the seventh floor. I don't understand what's happening,"" he said.,GTB hospital MS however says Prakash, who had been admitted on April 13 with low BP, was being treated for HIV with pneumonia. Said Dr P C Dikshit, ""He was found to be missing from his bed in the general ward after midnight. Initially, we thought he had gone to the bathroom, but his body was discovered by the guard later in the morning, when we informed the police."" Police sources corroborate the statement, saying the wife had admitted that her husband was depressed. Said a senior police official, ""The victim's wife has given a written statement that her husband had been depressed ever since he was told by the doctor that his condition was worsening."" While no suicide note has been found, a case under CrPC 174 has been filed, with a post-mortem scheduled to take place tomorrow.,Meanwhile, the Kumar family is fighting a battle, not only against the shock of Prakash's death, but also against prevailing prejudices. None of the neighbours know about Prakash or his family's HIV status. That the isolation is proving difficult can be seen from Amit's frantic attempts to keep the secret from his neighbours, as well as Prakash's wife's refusal to meet anyone. In fact, lack of counselling, say experts, could well be the reason behind the drastic act. In India, surveys have found that among truck drivers, who account for a majority of AIDS cases, almost 24-34% are HIV+. While government organisations are working to spread awareness, there are still many left out of the loop. For the Kumars though, the stats are cold comfort. With a seven year old who is also HIV+ and another three year old whose future is hanging in the balance, Prakash's wife is desperate for answers.,rumu.banerjee@timesgroup.com"

She is already suffering, why do you want to make her suffer more by depriving custody of her child,"" justice Mittal said. ,The court rejected the contentions of father-in-law Ram Gopal Verma, his wife Phoolwati and other members of his family and directed them to bring the child before it on Tuesday when custody of child would be handed over to the mother. ,The in-laws then pointed out that Sunita Verma, their daughter-in-law, was of bad character as she was suffering from the disease prior to marriage and it would have bad influence on the child. (,),The court, however, took strong exception to the argument and said that the disease was not inflicted only through physical relation but it could be transmitted due to blood transfusion. ,""It is unfortunate that after losing her husband she has been deprived of her child.

"May 7, 2008, 13:24 IST","Now, gum swab to spot HIV","NEW DELHI: A simple gum swab in place of an invasive blood test can now tell whether you are HIV positive. What's even better, the test results will be out in just 10-20 minutes. ,In a breakthrough that could replace the present day HIV antibody test through blood taken from the finger or the arm, a team of Indo-Canadian scientists has successfully tested the world's first saliva-based HIV test, with an accuracy rate of nearly 100%. ,The final results from the study, conducted in Maharashtra in 2006, by a team from McGill University Health Centre (MUHC), Canada, and Mahatma Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (MGIMS), Sevagram, were published on Tuesday in the international medical journal ���PloS Medicine'. ,This test is based on oral mucosal transudate (OMT), a fluid that is secreted at the base of the gums before it becomes saliva. ,Scientists found that the level of antibodies in OMT is comparable to that of blood plasma, making it an excellent sample for HIV testing. ,Lead author Nitika Pant Pai from MUHC's division of infectious diseases, said this new technique would do away with blood collection, which scares away patients from undergoing HIV test. The team now hopes that this research will pave the way for widespread use of oral HIV tests available over-the-counter. ,Rai conducted clinical trials on vulnerable pregnant women in the labour ward of MGIMS. She said that extracting blood in field settings poses a logistical problem because it needs injecting syringes and trained personnel. Now, all that one has to do is rub the stick against the gum twice to collect oral fluid. ,""The applicator on the stick, a strip of synthetic proteins, then detects HIV antibodies in 20 minutes or less. ,Standard blood test for HIV takes up to two weeks,"" Dr Pai said. She added that in India, it is vital to determine the HIV status of mothers very quickly to prevent transmission to the child during delivery. ,""Over 50% Indian women do not receive prenatal care and therefore don't get tested for HIV during pregnancy. Testing in the labour ward is the last chance to prevent HIV transmission to the newborn baby. Also Indian patients often refuse blood collection in fear of social ostracization, while saliva collection poses no problem. ,Thanks to this test, women were enrolled, received counselling, their test results confirmed and referred for treatment when found positive, within 40-60 minutes,"" she said. ,Globally, in 2007, about 2.1 million children were detected with new HIV infection - 90% of them having acquired it via maternal fetal transmission. ,Without rapid and accurate detection of HIV, no delivery of available PMTCT interventions (prevention of mother to child HIV transmission) is possible. Without anti-retroviral drugs, the probability of transmission is 30-35%. With ART, it is reduced to 10-15%. ,""In the labour room, due to inconsistent supply of blood-based rapid tests, they are often not available. Thus, many fail to get tested. In India, 4,755 infants were detected in 2005 attributed to mother-to-child transmission,"" Pai added. "

In the last three years, Delhi has had only four cases where a child, who first tested HIV-positive and later negative, was cleared for foreign adoption, since no one in India wanted them. In 2006, two cases of a girl child, one girl in 2007 and one girl in 2008 were tested HIV-positive and cleared for foreign adoption from Delhi, says Coordinating Voluntary Adoption Resource Agency (CVARA), which coordinates the functioning of registered adoption agencies in Delhi. ,Laila Baig, coordinator CVARA, says: ""There are around 1,100 families on the waiting list to adopt a child. But their first and foremost preference is a healthy child and it's understandable if parents don't want sick children."" Adoption agencies say that when they get children in their homes, all the medical tests are routinely performed on the child and only in rare cases do they find that the child is HIV-positive. Later, in subsequent tests, often tests turn out to be negative. ,In many cases, even when the child turns out to have a negative HIV status upon later tests, people are fearful of adopting. HIV-positive children are said to test negative only until they are one-and-a-half years old. After that, it's believed that their status largely remains unaltered. However, medical miracles do happen, opine experts, who add that adoption agencies have a definite role to play here in convincing families and educating them about the issue. ""If we have a child who is HIV positive-turned-negative, we tell the family about the child. After counselling and making them understand the medical aspects, if they are still willing, they accept the child. However, this happens only once in a blue moon,"" says Loren, coordinator, Delhi Council of Child Welfare, an adoption agency in Delhi. ,The adoption agency is in the middle of completing one such case of foreign adoption. Ten months ago they had found an Indian couple willing to adopt a one-and-half-year-old child, who had first tested positive, but was later found to be negative. However, the couple later decided against adopting the girl upon advice of their paediatrician, who claimed that her HIV-positive status could reappear even after 10 years. ""We have now found a Swedish family willing to adopt her and formalities will be completed in a few months."" ,The agencies understand the hesitation of families in coming forward to adopt such children. Due to lack of medical cover, insurance, social security in India, treating diseases of such a serious and fatal nature becomes all the more difficult. So the children are given to organisations which are working specially towards aiding HIV-positive children. Naz foundation is running one such home in the city which has around 35 children ��� orphaned and abandoned ��� living a life infected with the HIV virus. Children come here from adoption agencies, police and hospitals. ,The youngest one here is one year old and the oldest 15 years old. ""The children who come to us are those found abandoned by the police or left in hospitals. Sometimes adoption homes also send them to us. Here they are provided medical care and love that they need. They lead a normal life and go to school. Even HIV-positive children can live wholesome lives,"" says Anuradha Mukherjee, programme manager for the home. ,deeksha.chopra@timesgroup.com"

Given the stigma, children look towards social groups to share their anxieties and the clubs work towards offering protection.,Ganesh said children were working in 25 districts of which 22 were rural and three were urban. The decision to get them to work in particular districts was based on assessment of HIV/AIDS prevalence ��� the highest prevalence districts got a preference. ,Unicef and the central government have planned to involve 70 million youth in the HIV/AIDS awareness creation project by 2011. The project has begun and the pilot/trial period is on. ""We are midway. What we do in the immediate future depends on what results we obtain."",Karnataka particularly needs a boost in the campaign as it is among the states with the highest prevalence of HIV/AIDS.

With plans to test 22 million Indians every year from 2012 for HIV, the National AIDS Control Organisation (Naco) has just started trials of a new rapid testing technology that will not only tell you your HIV status within 20 minutes but will also do away with the present requirement of having to separate serum and red blood cells to test for HIV.,The Whole Blood Fingerprick Testing Technology (WBFTT), which has done wonders in Africa in increasing the number of people being tested for HIV, is being tried out at Integrated Counselling and Testing Centres (ICTC) in 10 districts of four states ��� Maharashtra, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu ��� to gauge its effectiveness in generating correct results.,Following the three-month trial of the technology, Naco will take a final call on whether to introduce WBFTT in its National AIDS Control Programme along with present day Serum HIV antibody rapid test.,Naco's ICTC expert Dr Suresh K Mohammed told TOI: ""The kits at present accept only serum to test for HIV antibody. The presence of HIV antibody in your blood itself says you are infected. This requires a centrifuge which separates the serum from the blood. The new technology being tried now accepts whole blood and can tell your HIV status by a simple finger prick."",Naco director-general K Sujatha Rao said the pilot project to check for WBFTT's efficacy and sensitivity was sanctioned by the National AIDS Control Board in its recent meeting on June 11.,""If WBFTT proves successful for use in the national programme, carrying out HIV testing will become simpler.

Each ICTC is manned by a trained counsellor and laboratory technician. HIV counselling and testing services are free of cost and the results are kept confidential. Since 2001, more than 18 million people have been counselled and tested.,According to Dr Mohammed, out of the 2.5 million people living with HIV/AIDS in India, only about 25-30% are aware of their HIV status. ""There is therefore an urgent need to increase access of ICT services which can be achieved through simpler HIV testing technologies like WBFTT. If the pilot project proves successful, WBFTT will be used for HIV testing in ICTCs in all round-the-clock public health centres,"" he added.,Dr Dennis Broun, UNAIDS country head, said that rapid HIV tests makes it possible for the patient to get pre-test and post-test counselling, their test results, and any medical referrals they may need, all in one visit."

As many as 58 prisoners have undergone tests at the ICTC centre in the last month. Prison officials say that with the new testing facility in place, it is simpler to motivate prisoners to go for the test. Earlier, they had to be taken to a government hospital for the test, which most of them were unwilling for. Now, the inmates can be counselled too, before they undergo the test.,According to industry estimates, there are about three lakh prisoners in jails across the country. The problems of drug abuse and HIV, said a prison official, need to be tackled together and if this is not controlled, it could become a major issue in our prisons. "

But, he knows little about being safe from the illeffects of HIV/AIDS. ,To create awareness about HIV/AIDS, the YMCA Bangalore Children in Crisis programme identified 40 such streetchildren for a five-day awareness camp from Tuesday at its Kumbalgud site. ,YMCA associate general secretary Dr Antony Issac, who has been working with street children since 1985, said such kids are easy targets for this disease due to their circumstances. He feels it is not the lack of money but rather access to quick money that makes them vulnerable at a very young age to drug abuse, smoking beedis, alcohol and even sex. ,Abandoned on the streets very early on, many are quite knowledgeable as early as the age of 14 when it comes to talking about substance abuse and alcohol. ""The first time you take a sniff, it takes you very high but then a couple of sniffs more and soon you get used to it,'' explains Appu (name changed), who also confesses to spending time satisfying his homosexual friends. ,Social worker T M Srinivas, who has been working with such children for the past five years, says the most difficult part of rehabilitation is the non-availability of details. ""Most would not even give us their proper names to escape being caught for rehabilitation,'' he said. A year ago during one such camp, a street child who tested positive for AIDS ran away from the camp when his friends told him about it. ,Playful, restless and superficially ignorant and casual, little do these youngsters know why they've joined this camp. When asked, they reply - ""Good food, time with friends and annas (their nicknames for counsellors) and then it's time to escape to our regular life'' . ,Daniel Rathnakar, secretary, says the camp is highly interactive and informal to ensure that they are made aware about the disease through games, exercise, films and discussions which they enjoy. ,toiblr.reporter@timesgroup .com "

A first-of-its kind study, conducted by WHO for India���s National AIDS Control Organisation estimates that nearly 10,000 HIV infected people ��� being treated by private physicians in India ��� were following irrational drug combinations and faulty regimens. ,This was making them resistant to the first line anti-retroviral (ART) drugs faster than usual. The study, presented at the 17th International AIDS Conference here, made another startling revelation ��� some Indian pharma companies were delivering the highly toxic ART drugs directly to the homes of HIV patients to overcome the patient���s reluctance to visit pharmacies, in fear of stigma and discrimination.,The survey, conducted in Delhi and Kolkata over three months from October 2007, also found that more than 1,500 patients being treated by private physicians had already been put on the second line ART. Around 17% of the drugs being recommended by these private practitioners to hapless patients were single ingredient drugs, while the standard international protocol to treat HIV patients is to give them a triple drug combination therapy.,Also, due to high cost of ART drugs, patients purchase them usually for 7-10 days before discontinuing treatment.,Further probing revealed that a majority of private physicians were prescribing ART drugs based on the information given to them by representatives of drug companies.,Naco���s director general K Sujatha Rao told TOI in Mexico City, ""It is vital for the drug controller general���s office to ensure that ART drugs aren���t sold over the counter ��� a trend which has now been noticed in India.

The private sector treats about 40,000 HIV patients. Normally, only 5% of those who follow the proper drug regimen and are on the right combination therapy develop resistance at the end of three years on treatment. ,Irrational use of such drugs, like the ones being practised by most of India's prvate doctors, can make patients resistant in just six months time."",According to Dr Rewari, most of the private doctors don't have enough time to counsel their HIV patients, resulting in lack of treatment adherence.,Naco officials say the HIV/AIDS Bill presently lying with the law ministry for approval stipulates that only those trained in prescribing ART drugs can do so. Globally, 25 drugs are used as part of ART out of which 17 are available in India.,Naco now plans to engage the private physicians and teach them how to treat HIV patients. ""It is most important that ART drugs are given in proper dosage and combination for it to be efficacious because every drug has a half life after which the serum concentration in the blood falls, making it ineffective,"" Dr Rewari added."

Canadian and American scientists have been working on finding what makes these elite controllers special and genetically what makes them so strong against HIV. ,Experts say these controllers account for about 1 out of 300 people infected with HIV but have been largely invisible to AIDS researchers because they do not get sick and therefore do not qualify for clinical studies. The roadmap puts forth a series of recommendations to help guide research to answer the critical scientific questions that have hampered AIDS vaccine development to date. Its has asked scientists working on developing the elusive AIDS vaccine to dump their candidate vaccines and not cling onto them with hope, if it fails to demonstrate superiority. On the other hand, if a candidate vaccines does show promise, scientists have been asked to test it rapidly, in smaller, more focused trials before moving them into conventional larges-cale efficacy trials contrary to what is done at present.,According to IAVI, current and future AIDS vaccine candidates need to be compared and prioritised in comparison to tested vaccines. Those vaccines that cannot demonstrate superiority should be dropped.,""Resources from these candidates should be freed and re-directed towards solving the key scientific problems currently impeding the development of the next generation of AIDS vaccine candidates,"" IAVI said.,More than 25 years have passed since the AIDS epidemic started and scientists have failed to find an effective vaccine against the virus that infects 7,500 people each day. To date, more than 25 million lives have been claimed by AIDS and 33 million people are estimated to have HIV. The world at present only has 20 anti-retroviral (ART) drugs in the market to suppress the virus for some time and control its symptoms.,Dr Seth Berkley, CEO of IAVI, said the development of an AIDS vaccine continued to be one the greatest needs of the 21st century and one of science���s greatest challenges. ""Developing an AIDS vaccine may take more time and innovation than we might have once imagined, but we are confident that science will prevail. The necessary direction for the field is clear,��� Berkley said. ���Strong scientific evidence in both human and animal models suggests that developing an AIDS vaccine is possible,��� said Dr Wayne Koff, senior VP (research and development) at IAVI.,Out of the 50 candidates that have been evaluated among humans till now, only two vaccines have made it through all three phases of trials, and both were rejected as quite ineffective. Despite the failures, about 30 vaccines remain in the pipeline, looking at different ways of stimulating the immune system. However, only one is in the phase III stage."

At present 12,000 of the 18,000 HIV pregnant mothers in India's national AIDS control programme are being administered Nevirapine.,Principal investigator Dr David Katzenstein, a professor of infectious diseases at Stanford, said, ""In the short term, Nevirapine is good. But in the long term, I'm concerned about conferring resistance and could jeopardise future treatment for mothers and infants."" ,Nevirapine and another drug Zidovudine (AZT) are the two drugs of choice to prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV globally. Worldwide, the drugs have been used as preventive tools in nearly 900,000 women and infants.,According to WHO guidelines, the regimen currently recommended for preventing mother-to-child infection in resource-limited settings uses a combination of AZT and single dose Nevirapine. However, Indian officials said this approach was much more difficult to administer than the single dose Nevirapine. ,Dr S Anuradha from Maulana Azad Medical College told TOI, ""We too have found that a single dose Nevirapine causes resistance. We are working towards providing a combination therapy during pregnancy. Mothers when tested later have become resistant to standard first line treatment."",She added, ""But the real problem in India is that of adherence and detection. Most women are detected with HIV when they reach the labour room or during early pregnancy. A single dose of drug can then be easily administered. At public health centres too, doctors can get pregnant women to have a single drug rather than multiple drugs."",At present, 38% of the 2.5 million HIV victims in India are women. Experts say around a third of women who take single dose Nevirapine develop drug resistant HIV, which can make subsequent treatment involving Nevirapine and Efavirenz less effective.,Dr Katzenstein and his colleagues looked at a group of 32 HIV-positive pregnant women in Zimbabwe. None of the women had been treated for HIV at the time of the study. The only drug they received was the single dose of Nevirapine when they went into labour, largely for the sake of their babies."

Muller said that if the kidney transplants were successful in the long term it would open the way to the use of other organs such as livers, which are particularly vulnerable to damage by anti-AIDS drugs, and hearts.,But receiving an HIV-infected organ is not without risks for the patient. In receiving donated organs, they can receive a new strain of HIV. If the strain is a drug-resistant strain, the recipient could also develop resistance to life-prolonging anti-retroviral drugs.

"Nov 2, 2008, 23:11 IST",High on HIV but safe in STD,"AHMEDABAD: Alarm bells are ringing among health workers of the city, for Ahmedabad has highest number of HIV cases in Gujarat. But, there is a strange contradiction: the city has the lowest number of sexually transmitted diseases (STD), as compared to the other major cities of Gujarat. ,Usually, incidents of STD are much more in frequency as compared to AIDS. In fact, the city had a very low occurrence of STD cases in the past three years. Number of STD cases is also an indicator of the HIV-AIDS vulnerability. However, according to commissioner health, medical services and medical educations report on its integrated disease surveillance project 2007 released recently, Ahmedabads urban areas have recorded highest number of HIV cases in state. ,The report points out that Ahmedabad has highest number of HIV cases, almost double compared to the most vulnerable city in Gujarat Surat. But in STD cases, Ahmedabad is in the safe zone. Urban Ahmedabad had 1,096 HIV patients in 2007, which was lower than 1,153 in 2006.,Ahmedabad Aids Control Society (AACS), however, postulates a reason for this sudden jump in AIDS cases. Dr Chirag Shah of AACS says, ""We have maximum number of integrated counselling and testing centres (ICTC) in city. AACS is operating 16 such centres. Many patients from outside the city also come here for HIV testing. This has resulted in more number of HIV cases being recorded in city."",""Particularly in Ahmedabad, the awareness is very high and people use condoms for safe sex. Secondly, we have five special STD clinics in city, so we are able to prevent STD cases. Through STD clinics, we arrive at definite indicators of HIV prevalence in vulnerable groups. Apart from this, many NGOs working in the area of HIV-AIDS have STD management as their priority. So situation in Ahmedabad is quite in control as far as STD cases are concerned,"" says Rajesh Gopal, joint director, Gujarat State Aids Control Society.,When STD cases are detected in rural areas they are often treated at nearby hospitals and clinics as the disease does not require upgraded and cutting-edge medical technology, as is required for tackling HIV-AIDS cases. As for AIDS victims, Ahmedabad offers better medical and diagnostic facilities. Thus the number of registered HIV cases is more in Ahmedabad. So the STD cases, which are actually indicators of local status, is less. ,In Gujarat, maximum number of STD cases was registered in Surat 21,020 in 2007. Vadodara came second with 1,573 cases and Bhavnagar with 1,180.

This includes children who require repeated blood transfusion for diseases like thalassemia or haemophilia,"" said Purandare. ,According to Oswal, a few cases have been documented in which the route of transmission is not known.

""She is always happy to meet us and takes her medicine as a part of her diet."",According to Prakash Sabde, state project director of the Maharashtra State AIDS Control Society (MSACS), ""Maharashtra has a high number of HIV-infected patients. Mumbai has the most and is followed by Pune and then Sangli,"" he said.,""Among the total number of HIV positive children, 85 to 90 per cent get the infection from their infected mother. These children are innocent bystanders caught up in this HIV epidemic,"" said Veda Purandare, senior medical officer at the ART centre at Sassoon General Hospital. ,""The remaining 10 to 15 per cent get the infection from the use of blood. This includes children who require repeated blood transfusion for diseases like thalassemia or haemophilia,"" said Purandare. ,According to Oswal, a few cases have been documented in which the route of transmission is not known. The only effective way to prevent paediatric HIV is to reduce HIV transmission from pregnant mother to baby. ""For this, our national programme of maternal and child health has to be strengthened. Also, it needs to be more effective in order to reach the masses,"" said Oswal. ,In India, a large number of pregnant women do not receive health care and deliver their babies at home. This puts the children at additional risk. These women should receive counselling and HIV testing, said Oswal. Pregnant mothers who are infected should also receive anti-HIV prophylactic drugs which can prevent HIV transmission to the baby, he added. ,At present, the government of India provides a single dose of Nevirapine (anti-HIV drug) to the mother and baby as prophylaxis. ,""This treatment can bring down the transmission to 47 per cent,"" said Oswal. ""However western countries use more effective regimens consisting of at least three drugs which can bring down the transmission drastically.

The Indian government should also adopt such a regimen, Oswal suggested.,Paediatrician Sanjay Lalwani, head of the department of paediatrics, Bharati Hospital and Research Centre, says 10 to 15 per cent of children who get the infection from their mothers die within the first two years.

Women���s liberation has touched a new high in Goa, with few women daring to put the lid on the unhappy marriages.,The latest trend, noticed over the past one year, has seen more than four women apply for either divorce or separation as their partners had hidden their HIV status at the time of marriage. ���We have registered number of cases of women who are married to HIV positive men, who either didn���t know their HIV status or didn���t disclose it before marriage. In 4 cases, the women after they knew of their spouse���s HIV status, wanted either divorce or separation. One of them was tested HIV positive,��� said Goa State AIDS Control Society chairperson Dr Pramod Salgaocar. ,Dr Salgaocar added, ���Most of the women are from Goan middle class families, who are in their early twenties. Once they know of their spouse���s HIV status, they feel cheated and betrayed. While some ask for separation, few opt for divorce. But many continue to live with the spouse and try to adjust with what fate has to offer.���,The surveillance data prepared by Goa State AIDS Control Society (GSACS) shows that of the estimated 12000 HIV positive individuals in the state, 38% are women and more than 85% are in the 15 to 29 age group.

In contrast, people with the H3 haplogroup progressed more than twice as slowly, the study found. ,This supports existing theories that mitochondria are implicated in the progression of HIV/AIDS. ""Having less energy available seems to exacerbate the effects of the disease,"" said team member Sher Hendrickson. ,""The U5a1 and J haplogroups seem to be responsible for this lack of energy. This means mitochondrial DNA tests could one day give an accurate prognosis for people with HIV, though further work on other genetic and environmental influence factors would be necessary first,"" said Hendrickson.

"Dec 21, 2008, 00:05 IST",HC allows wife to divorce HIV-positive husband,"MUMBAI: The Bombay high court recently upheld a family court order that dissolved a marriage on the grounds that the husband was HIV-positive and cruel. The court was hearing an appeal by the husband against the family court order, which observed that the HIV virus leads to AIDS, a venereal disease that is sexually transmittable and communicable.,The defence argued that a venereal disease is a sexually transmitted disease, which is not the case with HIV or AIDS. HIV can also be transmitted through various other means such as blood transfusions, sharing of needles, etc, the defence pointed out.,The high court, however, observed that venereal diseases loosely describe a class of diseases that are transmitted not ""exclusively'' by sexual contact but ""chiefly'' by sexual contact. ,Rashmi Shah (41) married businessman Bipin Shah (not their real names) on January 23, 1988. The couple have two sons. According to Rashmi, Bipin used to beat her up. In 1997, Bipin tested positive for HIV. The couple, who used to stay with Bipin's parents, then moved out of the house and started living in together in another flat. According to Rashmi, Bipin demanded that she restore sexual relations with him. Bipin denied the allegations and contented that he contracted HIV while undergoing treatment for a wound on his private part. In 2000, the couple once again decided to live with Bipin's parents. ,The family court, in an ex-parte order dated July 6, 2005, dissolved the marriage besides imposing certain maintenance conditions on the husband. Bipin challenged the order in the high court, which referred it back to the family court in November 2007. The family court passed an order in Rashmi's favour, which was once again challenged by Bipin in the high court.,A division bench of P B Majumdar and R P Sondurbaldota observed that it was the duty of husband to provide for his wife and protect her. The court also directed Bipin to provide a well-furnished accommodation to Rashmi in a good locality near their children's school. The court also directed Bipin to pay Rs 20,000 every month to Rashmi as alimony, besides Rs 15,000 every month to their minor son till the time he reaches adulthood. Rashmi told TOI, ""Now, I am looking forward to moving on in life.''"

However, a group of persons living with HIV/AIDS shed all inhibitions on Sunday as they came together at a Ghatkopar hospital to search for soulmates, in a first-time initiative which marked a progressive milestone for the city's HIV/AIDS movement.,Like any matchmaking session, the air was thick with anticipation as the 55 persons trooped into Sarvodaya Hospital. Their positive status meant that many had spent years trying to find a suitable match. ""I've been looking for a partner for the past four years. My family has been advising me to marry an HIV negative person, but I don't want to put someone else at risk,'' said Sushil Shinde (34) from Pune who received the harsh diagnosis nine years ago. ,A sari-clad Priya Kasbe scanned prospective beaus from a corner. Reticent by nature, she slowly explained that her parents had been groom-hunting, in vain. ""I hope to find someone who is financially stable,'' said Kasbe, pointing out that she had elderly parents and decided to get married when realisation struck that one day she may be sick and alone, with no one to look after her.,Some like Nerul resident Aniket Basu, who works in a BPO, had chosen to come there. ""There was a time when I thought I was HIV positive after an encounter with a girl. My results were negative but after that experience, I understood the pain and trauma of a person living with HIV/AIDS and have decided to marry one,'' he said.,The prospective grooms and brides came from across Maharashtra and were brought together with the support of voluntary organisation Action Aid and three other community-based organisations. Many left the hall, smiling with hope.,A couple from Pune who had found each other some months ago with help from one of the NGOs used the occasion to solemnise their wedding vows. ""I was looking for an HIV positive person with a child and have found one that fits perfectly,'' said Shanker Mali, lovingly casting a glance at his fiancee. They symbolically tied the knot on Sunday and plan to perform the rituals with their family later.,The life expectancy of persons living with HIV/AIDS (PLHA) has improved significantly thanks to better medication, with many leading normal lives for a decade. Roma Jana of Action Aid said PLHAs too had a right to start families. ""Such `melavas' (matchmaking sessions) are a sign that the stigma associated with HIV/AIDS is reducing, but it hasn't vanished. I look forward to the day HIV positive persons can freely advertise their status in matrimonial ads and on websites,'' added Jana.,However, counselling is important for PLHAs before having kids as their children run a high risk of being born with HIV/AIDS.,(Names of persons living with HIV/AIDS have been changed to protect their identities.)"

The state has registered around 500 full-blown cases, with some 2,511 suspected ones.,The chief minister told TOI that such medical procedures were compulsory not just to secure the lives of the bride and bridegroom, but also their children. ""But before implementing it in the state, public opinion will be taken,"" he said, while urging pregnant women to also go in for similar diagnosis and avail of medicines that could save child in their wombs from the deadly virus.,Promising testing kits at remotest areas of the state, besides forming AIDS consulting societies and launching special vans for the purpose, he added, ""Our efforts will be to stop further spread of the disease."",The health department has been reportedly taking legal opinion on the issue because the Supreme Court had already issued directions that tests would be voluntary in nature and not mandatory. ""We have to find out ways to come up with a detailed proposal and also take the help of National AIDS Control Organisation,"" said HP director of health services Sulakshna Puri.,Welcoming the initiative, senior BJP leader and state party incharge Satya Pal Jain said, ""People should be encouraged to go in for such tests. Why HIV/AIDS alone? There can be compulsory pre-marital tests for other diseases as well. Time has come when states ensure legislations to contain deadly diseases."",Himachal Pradesh Congress Committee president Kaul Singh Thakur is, however, skeptical. ""The decision will be effective only if adequate facilities are provided at primary and community health centres, especially in remote rural areas. Besides, there is need to create mass awareness."",Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh had mooted a similar idea to check AIDS a few months back."

According to the police, Deva Prabhakar of Guntur town took the help of an HIV patient to inject the infected blood into his sister-in-law when she refused to marry him. Prabhakar, who was married to the elder sister of the victim six years ago, had an affair with her, which the latter decided to end following a warning by her parents.,When he insisted on marriage, she lodged a police complaint. The cops threw him behind bars. After he came out of jail, he decided on revenge, and he did so by injecting her with HIV-positive blood on December 31. The police, instead of rushing the girl for medical attention, took more than four hours to register the FIR.,According to doctors, chances of declaring the girl HIV-free have reduced. ""It���s 100% possible to prevent the virus from spreading to other organs if a victim comes to the hospital within two hours of the infusion of toxic blood.

His family has alleged that he contracted the infection during his treatment when he received several blood transfusions and chemotherapy at the hospital.,Deepak, a lymphoblastic leukaemia patient, was undergoing treatment for the past two years at the hospital. ,``He underwent a blood transfusion in November last year and his condition deteriorated in December. So, I took him to GTB for a check-up. I couldn't believe when the doctor told me that his report was positive for HIV and Hepatitis B. He has been undergoing treatment for cancer at this hospital only and I have never got him treated at any other hospital,'' said his father, Tilak Ram, who is a small-time painter in Shahdara. Deepak's blood sample has been sent to G B Pant Hospital for a re-test.,The medical superintendent of the hospital, Dr P C Dikshit, denies responsibility. ``Firstly, we have not received any complaint from the boy's family in this regard. Secondly, it is very difficult to ascertain whether the boy contracted the infection during the blood transfusion at the hospital or not. He could have contracted the infection anywhere as he was not well and was being treated somewhere else.'',Deepak was diagnosed with lymphoblastic leukaemia in January 2007 and hospitalized for nearly eight months at GTB Hospital. ``He was initially being treated for tuberculosis of the lung but later I was told that he has cancer and that his treatment would continue for two years,'' said Tilak Ram. ``Till now, he has undergone 11 blood transfusions at the hospital. My wife and I were hoping that he would recover but this news has left us shattered. We have told him that he has some blood infection since he won't understand what HIV infection is.'' Tilak Ram has six children.,A senior doctor in the hospital said: ``Deepak was undergoing chemotherapy outside. He could have contracted the infection from anywhere. It is difficult to pinpoint one source until there is a detailed investigation, and even then it will be a difficult call. This is a rare and unfortunate case.'',Though government blood banks have made their procedures very stringent to ensure that blood is HIV free, there is still a small possibility of the blood carrying the virus. ,``A lot of precaution is taken while banking the blood,'' says Mohammad Shaukat, joint director, blood safety, National AIDS Control Organisation. ``We have various forms which a donor has to fill so that we can evaluate whether the donor is free from high-risk behaviour or not. There is though a small possibility of contracting infection from blood transfusion as the donor might be in the window period when he had donated the blood. The minimum time for the virus to be detected is at least 11 days. All blood banks follow high standards in testing for HIV but still it can't be said that the blood is 100% HIV infection free.'',Deepak's father is waiting for the blood test reports from GB Pant Hospital after which he says he will file a complaint against the hospital."

The committee has been asked to study the test results of the inmates and submit recommendations to tackle the problem of AIDS in prisons.,Though health activists say jail inmates constitute a high risk group, no figures are available on the number of HIV-positive prisoners. This makes it difficult to take steps for prevention of AIDS and provision of treatment to HIV-positive prisoners.,The matter came under the HC scanner last year during the hearing of a bail application by one HIV-positive prisoner who was serving life sentence in Pune's Yerwada jail. It came to light that between 2001 and 2006, 32 HIV-positive prisoners had died in Yerwada jail, many due to lack of proper treatment and care.

""Lack of selenium in the patient's body increased deaths due to complications of HIV by 20 times. And when there was an increase in selenium, the risk level fell. Now, if the African study is successful, it would mean that we have won the war. It may decrease or even change the dosage of the expensive antiretrovirals,"" said UK-based Dr Jag H Khalsa, chief, medical consequences branch, National Institute of Drug Abuse told a conference on molecular medicine at the Indian Institute of Technology.,Over nine months, the University of Miami team gave 91 HIV patients a daily capsule containing 200 micrograms of high-selenium yeast, and another 83 patients a daily placebo capsule. The two groups had similar selenium levels at the beginning of the study, but after nine months, levels were lower in the group taking the placebo. Those with higher selenium levels in their blood were more likely to have a lower HIV viral load, and a higher number of CD4 cells that play a key role in fighting infection.,""If little selenium alone can make a difference, we hope a combination of other elements will make it better,"" Dr Khalsa said.

So that such kind of situations could be prevented.,Giving a reason for this, president of the Kanpur Network of People Living with HIV AIDS, Shrikrishna said that Sushil is not the only one who was denied the treatment by the doctors after knowing the HIV status. In the recent past around three to four such cases have come to notice in which a number of HIV positive persons were denied treatment in the private and government hospitals.,Under this project all the 70 district of Uttar Pradesh would be covered. As for the sensitization of the doctors, 10 doctors and 10 volunteers have been shortlisted. All these people would be provided a three-day training programme starting from February 10 to 12. Later, these two groups would be divided into 10 teams and each team constituting of one doctor and one volunteer would be given the responsibility for covering around 7 district for the sensitization programme.,During the sensitization process the trainers would provide technical training to all the doctors regarding the correct way of treating an HIV positive without getting infected and also breaking the taboos. The doctors would also be informed that the HIV positives should not be kept in isolation even for the treatment purpose and should be kept in the same ward along with other patients.,Shrikrishna further said that the doctors would also be informed that before conducting an HIV test for a person, there should be a pre and post counselling session, along with a written consent letter of the person even if he or she is HIV negative. He concluded by saying that this scheme would definitely be helpful for the HIV positives, as they have to face much social boycott and at times denied admitted in the Hospital for the treatment of any other ailment."

Three samples of donor blood tested negative for the mandatory tests but tested positive for Hepatitis B after NAT. Two of these three donations also tested positive for Anti HBc (total), indicating past exposure to Hepatitis B virus. We have prevented a potential transfusion associated with Hepatitis B in as many as nine patients, as each unit of blood is separated into three components,"" Jeevan Blood Bank chairman Dr P Srinivsan said on Thursday.,The core antibody to Hepatitis B (Anti HBc Total) is positive in 10 - 12% of population suggesting they were ""exposed"" to the virus at some point in their life. But they remain negative for HBsAg as they have no symptoms or signs. ""Hence by the current testing practices followed in the blood banks they remain undetected. These people transmit the virus to the recipient, when blood donated by them is transfused and the recipient shows symptoms. Unfortunately, we don't have a look back programme in this country for data on number of patients who come back with infections,"" he said.,""Ensuring blood safety and prevention of transfusion-associated infections is the responsibility of all stake holders of health care delivery system. When an effective technology is available for prevention of a disease which could harm a life, it is the responsibility of blood banks to upgrade themselves.

""We are doing NAT tests for the last one week. Techincally we know its a safer method,"" he said.,Rejection of Anti-HBc (total) positive blood accounts for a loss of around 10% of blood donations and a financial loss of approximately Rs 12, lakh every year to a blood bank collecting 10,000 blood donations. In addition, over 1000 blood donors are asked not to donate blood again.,Urging the authorities for a revision in safety norms, Dr Srinivasan said: ""Safety is ignored citing an additional cost of approximately Rs 600 per blood component. It translates to an additional expense of Rs 1,800 for a common surgical procedure which is often a one-time event in someone's life. In any case, the amount is cheaper than a cost of bottled water a health conscious person spends for a year."""

"Reuters,Mar 9, 2009, 00:00 IST,Older people at greater risk of HIV (Getty images)",Older people at greater risk of HIV: Study,"Doctors are failing to diagnose HIV in older patients, who are exposed to greater risk of infection as erectile dysfunction drugs extend their sex lives, a study published by the World Health Organisation said. ,The report in the WHO Bulletin found that increasing numbers of sexually active people aged 50 and upwards - who are more likely to risk unprotected sex than younger people are contracting the AIDS virus. And although many people are having sex into their twilight years, HIV is still rarely considered as a cause of illness in older individuals. ,""Screening is less common for older adults, who are assumed not to be at risk,"" the study found. ""HIV prevalence and incidence in the over-50-year-olds seem surprisingly high and the risk factors are totally unexplored,"" the authors from the WHO and Minnesota's St. Olaf College said. ,Patients over the age of 50 make up roughly 8 per cent of new HIV diagnoses in Europe and 11 per cent in the United States, where rising numbers of older people are infected with the virus that spreads through sex, transfusions, and needle-sharing. ""These individuals have a shorter time from diagnosis to the onset of AIDS, reflecting both age-related faster progression to AIDS and doctors' failure to consider HIV as a diagnosis,"" the report said. ,Among the aged, the study said sexual activity is the most likely mode of HIV transmission. One reason for the increase in frequency is the use of impotence treatments that have allowed both men and women to have more sexual partners. ""Since 1998, erectile dysfunction drugs have been extending the sex life of many older individuals and, at the same time, may be extending the HIV epidemic into older age groups,"" the study said. ,""Older individuals are less likely than their younger counterparts to practice safer sex,"" it said. While the sexual activity of older people in poor countries has not been studied, and there is no data about the prevalence of HIV among the aged in the developing world, the WHO Bulletin study said similar trends were likely occurring there. ,""While erectile dysfunction is common and erectile dysfunction drugs are widely available in developing countries, no study has been done of their possible impact on the HIV epidemic, although their use in industrialised countries has been associated with risky safety practices,"" the report said. Older women appear to be at higher risk of contracting HIV if they have sex without a condom because of thinning with age of the vaginal mucous membrane, which gives natural lubrication.,Antiretroviral drugs have dramatically extended the life expectancy of people who catch HIV in rich economies, such as NBA basketball star Magic Johnson who announced his infection more than 16 years ago. But for those infected with HIV after the age of 65, the study said life expectancy is only four years. ""Waning immunity with age may be the reason,"" it said. About 33 million people worldwide are living with HIV, mostly in Africa. "

But one element is shared universally among the diverging strains -- a protein on the envelope of virus, called gp140, that HIV needs to infect immune cells. ,Prior research has shown that four randomly engineered antibodies that block the activity of that protein prevent the virus from infecting immune cells in culture, but all attempts to coax the human body into producing those four have failed. ,So, in their research, involving six infected people, the team isolated 433 antibodies from their blood serum that specifically targeted the envelope protein -- the chink in HIV's protean armour. ,Then they cloned the antibodies and produced them in bulk, mapped which part of the envelope protein each targeted, and gauged how effective each was in neutralising the virus. And, in the process, they identified a new structure within the envelope protein -- called the gp120 core. ,""Individually, they're not as strong as the Famous Four.

The couple committed suicide by consuming poison which they also gave to their two minor daughters, who died too. While the police are investigating the incident, initial inquiry suggested that the family was reportedly diagnosed HIV positive. ,The agony caused by the disease is being seen as a major reason behind the extreme step taken by the couple. ""The deceased's relatives told us that the couple was tested HIV positive a few years ago. They were suffering from pain and hence, may have committed suicide and killed their daughters,"" said L Katara, Makarpura police inspector. ,""We were told that the kids too were suffering from the disease. We have found some medical reports that showed the entire family to be HIV positive. But we haven't found any suicide note from the house,"" Katara told TOI. ,The couple were in the age group between 35-40 and their children were aged 4 and 15.

No further trials are required to establish that HIV infection rates are reduced in heterosexual men for at least the first two years after circumcision,"" says lead researcher Nandi Siegfried, Co-director of the South African Cochrane Centre at the South African Medical Research Council. ,""Policy makers can consider implementing circumcision as an additional measure into HIV prevention programmes,��� Nandi added.,Circumcision may help to protect against HIV by removing cells in the foreskin to which the virus is specifically attracted. Called Langerhans cells, they display receptors that enable HIV entry. Previous non-randomised studies investigated the association between circumcision and HIV, but until now, Cochrane researchers have been unable to make strong recommendations for the intervention due to a lack of high quality evidence gained from randomised clinical trials.,The clinical trials included in the review took place in South Africa, Uganda, and Kenya between 2002 and 2006, and included a total of 11,054 men. The results show that circumcision in heterosexual men significantly reduces their risk of acquiring HIV by 54 percent over a two year period, compared with uncircumcised men. This reduced risk is the best estimate of the average effect and the researchers report that the true risk will be reduced by between 38 to 66 percent. ,Further research, however, is required to establish whether male circumcision offers any benefit to women partners of circumcised men and homosexual men.,The researchers warn that policy makers also need to think about the culture and environment in which circumcision is carried out. ,""In many countries, male circumcision is practiced as part of the rites of initiation by traditional healers who are not trained in aseptic surgical techniques.

This recommendation was formulated from data based on older medications that produced more side effects than current treatments,"" explained Klein. ,""Current therapies cause fewer side-effects, are better tolerated and more effective so we can safely start treating patients earlier."" ,This study is the first of its scope to measure the risk of death based on the progress of infection at the start of treatment.

Chronic heart or lung conditions make people more vulnerable to influenza viruses in general."",""We also now know that people who have HIV infections can be susceptible to many infections and with influenza viruses HIV infected populations are one of the groups of people who can be somewhat more heavily impacted than people who are healthy. We need to know who are the different groups of people who are going to be disproportionately affected if a pandemic breaks out,"" Dr Fukuda said.,WHO says regular seasonal flu kills between 250,000 and 500,000 such people a year.,The apparent spread of the H1N1 influenza virus has many people living with HIV concerned about their health and safety in India.,But a health ministry official said while there are reasons to be cautious, there's still no reason to panic.,At present, the H1N1 is sensitive to two known drugs, Relenza and Tamiflu, and there is little evidence to suggest that these drugs cannot be safely combined with anti-retrovirals (ARVs) used to treat HIV. The flu medications work much like ARVs -- they prevent the influenza virus from reproducing in the body.,According to WHO and CDC, people at high risk of serious influenza-related complications, including people living with HIV/AIDS, can take Relenza or Tamiflu as post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) to prevent the flu. However, PEP is only recommended for HIV-positive people who have a known exposure to the virus if a household member is diagnosed with H1N1.,Officials said HIV-infected persons should be considered as a high risk and a priority population for preventive and therapeutic strategies against H1N1. WHO recommends that patients at higher risk for complications of influenza should be among those prioritized for antiviral treatment with oseltamivir or zanamivir which shortens illness duration and severity in seasonal influenza. The WHO advises that it is best if people infected with the flu strain start taking the antivirals within 48 hours of the onset of symptoms.,Because of the unique vulnerability of people living with HIV (PLWH), it is recommended that they consult the HIV clinical care provider during this heightened alert as a preventative action. If signs and symptoms of flu do occur, the PLWH should contact the HIV clinical care provider immediately, WHO says."

Despite the incidence being higher, the awareness levels are inexplicably low.,Consultant gastroentrology Dr Dinesh Kini says acute viral hepatitis usually results in fatigue, fever, nausea and vomiting, but these are common to many other diseases. Therefore, to make a diagnosis, a clinician will often need to use additional tests. Hepatitis C is often referred to as a silent killer.,Hepatitis is an inflammation of the liver that is caused by various viruses. Over time, Hepatitis seriously damages the liver and can eventually lead to hospitalization, liver cancer, and the need for liver transplantation or even death.,Hepatologist Dr B S Satyaprakash says there are at least six different strains of the Hepatitis virus, including Hepatitis A, B, and C. Hepatitis B and C are considered the most serious strains and affect the greatest number of people. It can become life-threatening if it remains undetected for long.,According to Dr Satyaprakash, most patients of Hepatitis C in India have contracted the infection from blood transfusions. Injections or operations using non-disposable re-used needles or equipment accounts for about a third of the cases. Also, Hepatitis B is often transmitted unknowingly from a `carrier' mother to her offspring and, hence, tends to affect other family members.,Doctors warn that people tattooing or piercing their bodies (using unsterilized equipment) should be careful. Hepatitis B can be prevented by taking three doses of Hepatitis B vaccine. Currently, there is no vaccine for Hepatitis C. The best way to prevent HCV is to avoid high-risk activities.,SILENT KILLER,* `Am I Number 12?' is a campaign launched by the World Health Alliance to highlight the growing incidence of Hepatitis and the disease's magnitude.,* World wide, an estimated three to four million people are infected with the virus each year.,* In India alone, the death rates from Hepatitis C exceed over 100,000 per year.,* Every 15th carrier is an Indian, which results in about 12.5 million sufferers in India alone.,* HBV and HCV kill ten times more people than HIV every year (WHO estimate)."

The rate of HIV infection in the women was 0.17 percent.,The results showed that women who experience violence from their partners were more than three times as likely to have HIV infection as women who do not.

But those who used marijuana to target a particular symptom were actually more likely to stick closely to their ARV regimen too. ,The researchers say that patterns of how marijuana use interferes with patients��� adherence to medication regimens, along with other drugs, warrant further study.,According to them, data suggest that marijuana is a trigger among those susceptible to psychosis, and is also associated with the risk of suicidal thoughts. But it is not linked to an increased risk of lung cancer.,The question of the use of marijuana for symptom management when legal drugs are available remains a practice and policy issue.,""Given that marijuana may have other pleasant side effects and may be less costly than prescribed or OTC drugs, is there a reason to make it available? These are the political ramifications of our findings.

Instead, the disease persists within the body - much like water in a reservoir - and is never fully destroyed. We believe our latest research may help scientists and physicians overcome this hurdle,"" the researcher added. ,The researchers say that their study enabled them to identify a possible new way of attacking HIV by first identifying the specific cells where HIV infection persists in patients currently undergoing treatment. ,They have found that the disease is able to survive within two subsets of memory T-cells. ,Memory T-cells are a portion of the body''s immune system and have the ability to learn, detect and attack certain types of infectious diseases. ,The team say that HIV avoid antiviral treatments by infecting cells within the body���s own immune system, and that it uses the body''s own defence system as a hideout. ,As to how the HIV-infected memory T-cells replenish themselves, the researchers found that when populating T-cells, HIV does not replicate itself as it does in other cell types on the body. ,They say that HIV instead persists in memory T-cells through cell division, a finding that holds significant implications for possibly stopping the disease.,""Based on this research, we believe one possible method for eliminating HIV in the body is to use a combined approach. We propose the use of medications that target viral replication of HIV throughout the body, in combination with drugs that prevent infected memory T-cells from dividing. We believe that by attacking the disease in these distinct two ways at once for an extended period of time, we can eliminate the reservoirs of HIV that currently persist within the human body, leaving an individual disease-free,"" said Dr. Sekaly.,The researchers say that they will next use animal models and newly developed therapies to test their proposed treatment method.,""While this is a preliminary finding, we are hopeful that this research discovery will guide us in eradicating HIV infection in the body,"" said Dr. Sekaly.,The findings of the study have been reported in the online edition of the journal Nature Medicine."

We hope that these findings will lead to further studies and possible new therapies for treating or preventing tuberculosis in HIV disease,"" said Patel.,For their study, the researchers extracted immune cells called ""alveolar macrophages"" from the lungs of otherwise healthy, asymptomatic HIV-positive patients as well as from people who did not have HIV. ,In people who are HIV-positive, the macrophages have a decreased response to the TB bacterium when compared to people who did not have HIV. ,To know why this happens, the scientists examined lung specimens from the HIV-positive patients, and found increased levels of a molecule called IL-10.,IL-10 elevated the amount of a protein called ""BCL-3"" in alveolar macrophages, which in turn reduced their ability to ward off TB infection. ,""HIV and TB represent two of the most significant health challenges in human history and the combination of the two infections is particularly devastating because HIV dramatically increases the severity of TB infection,"" said Dr. John Wherry, Deputy Editor of the Journal of Leukocyte Biology, ,He added: ""There are still many unknowns about how HIV reduces the ability of the body to combat other infections. This study sheds light on co-infection with HIV and TB, which up to this point, has perplexed scientists and physicians alike."",The study has been published in the Journal of Leukocyte Biology. , "

Already, 15% of this community is infected as access to information and condoms are limited.,Speaking to TOI, Dr Charles Gilks from UNAIDS said, ""Section 377 of the IPC, that made homosexuality a criminal offence, was an impediment to our working effectively with the MSM community. Fear of harassment made them stay underground, thereby making it difficult for us to map the size of this community."",Dr Gilks added, ""It will take a long time for the public attitude towards MSMs to change. But Thursday's judgment will make it easier for us to reach out to the MSM community and include them in targeted interventions that will protect them against HIV by making sex between males safer."",Interventions include behavioural change education, services to treat sexually transmitted infections, providing condom and lubricants, linking them with integrated counselling and testing centres and providing them with life saving anti-retroviral drugs if infected.,Under India's National AIDS Control Programme II (NACP II), till a year back, only 30 TIs were dealing with the MSM community.,At present, the number of such MSM-specific interventions stands at 184, covering 70% of the population. Each of the TIs are being allocated Rs 12-18 lakh per year for implementation.,""Around 30 more TIs are being planned for MSMs. Because such interventions are based on self-identification, the judgment will help more MSMs come out in the open,"" a NACO official said.,Former health minister A Ramadoss, who was the first to favour an amendment to Section 377, told TOI Section 377 was an archaic law and must go. ""I welcome the judgment and it's a way forward. Because it was criminal to be a homosexual till now, these people never came out in the open and infection rates were very high. Now health workers can fearlessly reach out to the MSM community to protect them against HIV,"" Ramadoss said.,According to government estimates, 5% of all sexually active males in India have sex with other men.,A report from American Foundation for AIDS Research recently said MSMs were 19 times more likely to be infected with HIV than the general population, yet were ignored in many countries.,Criminalisation of sexual activity between males was a major driver of the epidemic in many countries, the report concluded. Seven of 10 countries with the highest reported HIV rates among gay and bisexual men criminalise homosexuality.,Globally, 86 countries criminalise sexual activity between males. In seven countries, sexual activity between males is punishable by death."

A complaint was filed one-and-a-half-months later on July 18, 2005. The Vasco police registered a case under Sections 342, 376 and 506(ii) of IPC and Section 8 of the Goa Children's Act. The matter was before the the JMFC court and the police closed the case as A-final in 2006, without filing a chargesheet. However, now, at the age of 11, the minor girl has tested positive for HIV. ,TOI had reported the minor's tale last month. Soon afterwards, the victim's family approached SCAN for assistance in the rape case. Subsequently, SCAN has sought transfer of the case, pointing out that under Section 34 of Goa Children's Act, the JMFC court is barred from hearing cases concerning rape of minors. The appellant has also pointed out that Section 34 excludes all courts, other than the Goa children's court, from hearing matters pertaining to offences against children.,As per Section 34 of Goa Children's Act 2003, ""no other court, civil or criminal, shall have jurisdiction to decide or deal with any offence or any question or any dispute or any liability which by or under this Act is to be decided by the children's court, except by appeal to the high court or Supreme Court"".,The NGO has further pointed out in its appeal that Section 30(1) states that ""subject to the provision of this Act, the children's court shall have jurisdiction to try all offences against children whether such offence is specified under this Act or not"". ,Interestingly, even in the past a similar criminal case filed in 2005 in Vasco JMFC court was transferred to the children's court after similar intervention.

"AFP,Jul 18, 2009, 00:00 IST,AIDS (Getty Images) ",HIV circumcision doesn't shield women,"Circumcision of men with HIV does not reduce the risk of infection for women, according to a study published on Friday by The Lancet. ,Male circumcision unleashed a wave of optimism among AIDS campaigners three years ago when trials in Kenya, Uganda and South Africa found foreskin removal more than halved men's risk of infection by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). ,Last year, longer-term analysis of one of the trials found the benefit to be even greater than thought, with a risk reduction of 65 percent. ,One of the big questions, though, is whether male circumcision could also reduce the risk for women who have intercourse with an HIV-infected man. ,The answer, according to a randomised trial carried out in Uganda, is a clear ""No."" ,Doctors enrolled 922 uncircumcised Ugandan men aged 15-49 who were badly infected with HIV but who did not show any symptoms. ,Half of the group then had circumcision, while the other half remained uncircumcised. ,The researchers also enrolled HIV-uninfected women who were partners of the male volunteers. These numbered 90 women in the circumcised group, and 70 in the uncircumcised groups. ,All participants were intensively schooled in HIV prevention. ,The trial was halted at a partway stage because it would have been futile and questionable to carry on. ,Analysis of data after two years made it clear that there was no protection: 18 percent of women in the circumcised group who were examined at the follow-up point had become infected, as opposed to 12 percent in the control group. ,Most of the infections in the circumcised group occurred within six months after circumcision. ,This may have been because some of the men had intercourse without giving time for the circumcision wound to heal properly, thus exposing the woman to HIV-infected blood in the vagina. ,That finding was surprising and provides a lesson for programmes to promote male circumcision as a cheap, effective method of preventing HIV among men, say the authors. ,Men who undergo circumcision must be closely counselled about strictly observing sexual abstinence until the wound heals, and about also using condoms to stop infecting their partner. ,The doctors, led by Maria Wawer of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore, Maryland, say they were disappointed with the outcome. ,They stress, though, that circumcision campaigns are still valid. ,Even if women do not directly benefit from male circumcision, they get an indirect advantage, because the fewer men who are infected with HIV, the lesser the risk to women. ,A study published in October last year in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) found that the protective benefit of circumcision to male heterosexuals does not appear to extend to male homosexuals. ,Among 53,567 men who reported having male sexual partners, researchers found little difference in the rate of HIV infection between those who were circumcised and those were not. ,The theory behind the effectiveness of circumcision is that the inner foreskin is an easy entry point for HIV. It is rich in so-called Langerhans cells, tissue that the AIDS virus finds particularly easy to latch on to and penetrate. ,Other questions surrounding circumcision campaigns are the need to ensure that operations are done hygienically and with the full knowledge and consent of the male.

It turned out this mother had fed her daughter pre-chewed food,"" said Gaur.,After that he encountered two similar cases previously reported by senior author Mitchell and colleague Rivera from the University of Miami. ,One case involved pre-chewing by an HIV-infected mother, and the other an HIV-infected aunt who was the caregiver.,Gaur said that information in the three cases suggests that one factor aiding such transmission was mouth bleeding in the caregiver, as well as in the infant due to teething or infection. ,The findings of the study have been published in the journal Pediatrics."

Faulty kits put a question mark about the number of persons who missed an accurate diagnosis. ,The Delhi HC case pertains to the quality of testing kits, a petition converted into a PIL in 2008 and the recent directives for re-testing were issued on May 25, 2009. ,With the next hearing scheduled for August 12, local bodies like the Mumbai District AIDS Control Society (MDACS) are seeking re-testing of persons. But officials from the National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) seemed clueless about any such directive. ""I haven't heard of any such directive but re-testing at our centres is impossible,'' said a senior NACO official. ,MDACS chief S Kudalkar said they had traced the names of around 33,572 persons across their centres in Mumbai. ""It is those who tested negative in those three months who are a cause for worry. Since they aren't tested again, if their result is wrong, they could have missed appropriate treatment,'' he said. ,Dr Alaka Deshpande who heads state-run JJ Hospital's AIDS centre said the use of faulty tests could also have led to pregnant mothers being missed, putting their child at a greater risk of acquiring the infection."

The workshop, which is being attended by officers from across the country, will end on August 1.,""Advancements in medical science has changed the nature of HIV/AIDS from once a death warrant to a chronic, manageable disease. But people who suffer from this disease need care and support. We also need to fight the social stigma attached to HIV/AIDS,"" he said. Explaining the need for awareness, Khanna cited the case of a unit that returned to India from abroad with 75 per cent of the personnel infected with HIV.,Delivering the welcome address, Lt Gen Shiv Kumar Sharma, the director and commandant of the AFMC, outlined the research work being carried out by the institute to fight the disease.

""Today, AIDS is no longer the top cause of morbidity.

Efforts to promote vaccines should consider that students who aren''t worried about being harmed are less likely to get the vaccine, even when it''s warranted by their sexual behaviour,"" said Ravert. ,The researchers found that the strongest predictor of vaccine acceptance in the study was students'' perceived susceptibility to contracting HIV, followed by their number of sexual partners. ,Students'' decisions also were influenced by the cost of the vaccine.,The study was published in the latest issue of the American Journal of Health Behaviour."
"Aug 2, 2009, 20:42 IST",Undertrial of district jail found HIV+,"VARANASI: Efforts to create awareness among masses regarding the causes of HIV/AIDS are definitely falling short of expectations. This fact was reinforced by the recent detection of an HIV positive case at the district jail.,The Central Jail unit of Integrated Counselling and Testing Centre (ICTC) of National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) had started counselling and testing of the undertrail prisoners of the district jail from July 18. After this unit started yielding positive results at Central Jail, the senior jail superintendent SC Srivastava decided to hold camps of this unit at district jail on every Saturday.,Till date, three camps have been organised at the district jail where facilities of counselling and blood tests have been provided to 98 undertrial prisoners. During the second camp at the district jail, one prisoner was found to be HIV positive. During counselling session, it came to light that the undertrial was a railway vendor at railway station and had got affected by sexual transmitted disease due to unsafe sexual practices. The counsellor of Central Jail unit of ICTC, Arvind Singh, admitted that the anti-retro viral treatment of the prisoner had been started from NACO's Banaras Hindu University centre.,Now the unit staff have also intensified efforts to create awareness among other prisoners regarding the ways of transmission of this dreaded disease to ensure that no discrimination is being faced by him. This is not the first case of detection of HIV positive in the jails of Varanasi. Srivastava informed TOI on Sunday that before the ICTC unit started at his jail in January last, one prisoner was detected with HIV positive case. On the grounds of sharp deterioration in his health condition, he was granted bail by the court, said Srivastava and added the prisoner left for Mumbai for treatment.,After the opening of ICTC unit at Central Jail, five HIV positive cases were detected there and ART was being provided to all of them. Srivastava said before the special camps of ICTC Central Jail unit started at the district jail, one HIV positive case had existed there as well. But, unlike the Central Jail, where prisoners turned up to the ICTC unit voluntarily, ensuring a voluntary participation of the prisoners of district jail at the special camps was not proving to be an easy task.,The new prisoners coming to the District Jail or those being referred to the camp by doctors of jail hospital were mainly counselled or being taken for blood tests. This is the main reason for the low number of prisoners covered during three camps at the district jail where the number of prisoners is several hundred. If the jail authorities are to be believed, some prisoners also tried to complain before the court that they were being forced to attend the camp. Due to these reasons, not only the unit staff but the jail authorities are trying to emphasis on increasing awareness among the prisoners. In the same bid, Singh said, some jail authorities like a jailer of district jail also came forward for the voluntary test during last camp of the unit."

The first such instance was reported from Latur, where students boycotted classes as HIV +ve students were being allowed to enter the school. A similar boycott took place at a zilla parishad school in Amravati district.,""It's a fact that a section of students were boycotting the classes to protest against the admission of HIV +ve students but now we have convinced the students that there is absolutely no possibility of contracting the disease,'' Sunil Deshmukh, guardian minister of Amravati said.,A month ago, students of Hasegaon village in Latur district had boycotted the school for well over a month to protest against the admission of HIV positive students. In fact, the gram panchayat had passed a resolution, saying, no student from the village will attend the school till the HIV +ve students were expelled.,The row was resolved following the intervention of a section of NGOs and senior government officials. Students and parents were told that there was no threat of infection to the students, if they sit with HIV +ve children. However, an identical situation was witnessed in Amravati, the home town of president Pratibha Patil.,It was found that following the admission of 10 HIV +ve students in a zilla parishad school, the villagers not only conducted a strong protest, but also boycotted the school for a week. Normalcy was restored only after Deshmukh's intervention, a doctor by profession. ""Initially, there was a protest, but we have explained the situation to the parents. We told them that merely by sharing seats in the classroom, students will not become HIV positive,'' Deshmukh told TOI on Wednesday.,Not only Maharashtra, but major states across the country were also facing an identical situation, said a senior health official. Even as a section of NGOs have taken up the cause of HIV +ve students, there was no response from the district administration.,""In Maharashtra, we have nearly 13,000 HIV positive students. Post the Latur and Amravati school episodes, HIV +ve students appear to be uneasy. We are witnessing a new trend. We will have to motivate both HIV positive, non-HIV +ve students and tell them there is no need for panic. We will have to give them more information about the condition,'' the official said.,According to him, it was not possible to either isolate the HIV positive students or set up a special school for them. ""If we set up a special school for them, it will be disastrous. We will never advise taking such a step,'' he said."

This would come as reassuring news for countries where HIV treatment coverage with ART drugs is good.,However, according to the WHO's estimates, around 33 million people are living with HIV/AIDS worldwide. Of these, only 4 million were receiving ART at the end of 2008.,India is one of the countries where coverage with ART is still not that high. Of the 23 lakh estimated cases of HIV in the country, only 2.4 lakh are undergoing ART. This means HIV patients in India need to be extra careful about H1N1 symptoms.,Speaking to TOI, NACO director general K Sujatha Rao said, ""At the recent chief ministers' conference, the Maharashtra government reported two deaths of H1N1 patients who were found to be HIV positive. We have therefore started to keep a tab of H1N1 infection in the country's HIV community and have sent an advisory to all our ART centres asking them to educate patients about H1N1."",According to the WHO, swine flu is spreading four times faster than other viruses and 40% of the fatalities are young adults in good health. More than 2,180 people around the world have died from the virus since it emerged in April.,""This virus travels at an unbelievable, almost unheard of speed,"" WHO DG Margaret Chan said. ""In six weeks, it has travelled the same distance that other viruses take six months to cover. Around 40% of the fatalities concern young adults -- in good health -- who die of a viral fever in five to seven days. This is the most worrying fact. Up to 30% of people in densely populated countries risk getting infected,"" Chan added.,WHO has already said that in many countries, the virus had overtaken others to become the most prevalent flu strain.,The UN agency has said that people with immunodeficiency diseases -- including AIDS -- will most likely be vulnerable to health complications from the H1N1 strain. ""HIV and the new flu strain could also mix together in a dangerous way, as has occurred with HIV and tuberculosis,"" the WHO said.,HIV-infected persons should be considered as a high risk and high priority group for preventive and therapeutic strategies against influenza, WHO added.,Antiviral medicines such as Tamiflu and Relenza decrease the duration of virus excretion and the severity of illness when used for treatment of ill patients, and may also prevent illness when used for prophylaxis.

They attribute the dramatic rise in cases to better medical infrastructure for detecting HIV. They point out that the number of Integrated Counselling and Testing Centres (ICTCs) for HIV increased from 1,476 to 5,155 in the last three years. The number of Anti-Retroviral Treatment (ART) centres which provide care and detect new cases also increased from 52 to 217.

The same number increased by more than 10 times to 4,714 in 2008. And this year 1,269 fresh cases have already been detected until May. The government has admitted that the prevalence of HIV is especially high in Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. ,Doctors explain that the major source of infection in children is through vertical transmission of the HIV virus from an HIV-positive pregnant mother to the infant. To arrest this trend the Union government started a programme in 2002 to provide both prophylactic medicines and counselling to HIV-positive pregnant women. In 2008, 4.1 million pregnant women were counselled and tested across India. Of these, 19,986 were found HIV-positive.,But despite the rise in number of fresh cases the government claims there has been a ""stabilisation of the HIV epidemic''. ""The prevalence rate of HIV has reduced from 0.45% in 2002 to 0.34% in 2007. States like Maharashtra have also shown a decline in HIV prevalence rates,'' a central government official said."

"Oct 24, 2009, 05:13 IST",Spurt in number of HIV mothers,"DARBHANGA: A sudden increase in the number of HIV positive pregnant women reaching the gynaecology department of Darbhanga Medical College Hospital (DMCH) for delivery this month indicates the presence of a large number of HIV infected women in Darbhanga district. ,DMCH superintendent Dr Suraj Nayak told TOI on Friday that earlier only two to three HIV infected women use to come to DMCH for delivery every month but in October this year 11 women had already visited DMCH for delivery. While seven women had delivered children normally, the remaining four had to undergo Caesarean section. ""DMCH had sufficient number of HIV protective kits for use by doctors. Hence there was no problem in handling such cases at the hospital,"" Dr Nayak said. ,However, he had been receiving reports that sometimes Grade IV staff and some nurses of the gynaecology department discourage the attendants of such patients from admitting their wards in the hospital on one pretext or the other. Hence, he had notified that anybody found indulging in such practice would be severely dealt with. ,Dr Raj Arora, resident surgeon in the gynaecology department, performed Caesarean section on the HIV infected women. Dr Nayak further said at the anti-retroviral treatment centre, which has been functional at DMCH for the past year, more than 1,600 HIV patients had been registered for treatment so far. This was also indicative of the presence of a large number of HIV patients in this area. "

"Shruthi Balakrishna,Nov 16, 2009, 04:25 IST",Mainstream Institutes Still Not Ready For HIV+ Kids,"BANGALORE: Her dimpled face and sunny smile won Swaroopa many friends. This, despite a few of her friends being aware that she is HIV+. ""When I told my close friends about my HIV infection, they did not believe me initially. Later, they not only became closer to me, but are very supportive,"" she says.,Losing both her parents to the deadly virus at an early age, this Class 10 student not only managed to get shelter, but also education, in a private school. What's more, she has never faced any discrimination either from her friends or teachers. ""All my teachers are aware of my condition. They treat me the way they would treat any other children. My friends don't isolate me. They sit next to me in class, hold my hands... like any other friends do,"" Swaroopa adds.,But not everyone is as fortunate as Swaroopa. A couple of her friends who, too, are HIV+, wanted to change school after they felt isolated. ""When we coughed or sneezed, we were sent to a corner at the classroom. But it was not the same with other children. That's when I decided not to attend school,"" says Pawan, now pursuing a vocational course.,And those who are going to school want to keep their condition under wraps, as they fear being stigmatized. ""I don't want even my best friends to know about my infection. What if others also come to know and stay away from me?"" says Rakesh, 17, studying in Class 10 in an aided school.,The discrimination and stigma pose a challenge, especially when the Centre has passed the Right To Education (RTE) Bill, which provides free and compulsory education for children aged 6 to 14 years. According to the National Family Health Service (NFHS) 2005-06, the estimated number of HIV+ people in the state is 2.5 lakh. But no one knows how many children are carrying this deadly disease.,WHAT DO TEACHERS SAY?,Teachers and some NGOs feel the children are too young even to understand whether they are discriminated against or not. ""There is discrimination, but it takes place in a subtle way. For instance, if they are talkative or naughty in class, they are sent outside, which would not be the case with other children,"" says a teacher, on condition of anonymity.,Further, teachers say that in government schools, no child is denied admission, but many private schools are apprehensive about enrolling such children. ""One might enrol a child but you never know what happens to them in school. In some cases, children are small, so they don't understand what's happening to them,"" the teacher adds.,JOINING THE MAINSTREAM ,Freedom Foundation, an NGO focusing on various issues related to HIV+ and substance abuse issues, says it's still a major issue if a school learns that the child is HIV+.,""Why can't an HIV+ child study in a premier institution? Ignorance and fear are the main factors behind discrimination. Even if there is any awareness, there is continuous anxiety and fear,"" says Ashok Rau, executive trustee and CEO, Freedom Foundation.,The Foundation is working towards putting children into the mainstream. ""We want them to be part of the normal system. How can any school be sure that a child studying in their institute is not HIV+? It's possible to admit the child without revealing the condition, but the purpose of enrolling them into the mainstream is defeated,"" he says. However, when the Foundation admits a child into school, the child's condition is revealed to the principal and teacher. ""They too maintain confidentiality,"" Rau adds.,WHAT IS THE GOVERNMENT DOING? ,The government is creating awareness on the issue for teachers and students through life skill programmes. ""According to information provided by the state health department in 15 districts, no HIV+ cases have been reported in any school. About 50 lakh children from Class 1 to 10 are covered in these districts. In case any HIV+ cases are reported, we will see that the child is given the required treatment and facilities so that he or she can pursue education,"" says Dr Nagalakshmi C S, chief medical officer in the education department.,The department has initiated awareness programmes highlighting how HIV spreads. ""We make it clear to children that by studying or eating together, HIV does not spread. Above all, we tell them to treat HIV+ children like any other,"" she adds. ,Commissioner for public instruction B A Harish Gowda said it's difficult for the department to detect HIV+ children. ""If a child is unwell, the teacher sends the child home or if the child is really sick, he or she does not attend school at all,"" he added.,Psychologists suggest that it's important to see there is no self-pity. In a few organizations, children are taught how to take things in their stride. ""Creating awareness about these children among teachers and parents will make a lot of difference. These children can perform tasks like any others. The reaction from society can dampen their self-esteem. Steps can be taken to boost their self-esteem,"" says Dharitri Ramprasad, a clinical psychologist. "

Inmates aged between 22 and 35 years told doctors that they had never heard the words like HIV and AIDS.,Dr Meesum told TOI that health authorities have told inmates that commercial female sex workers, men having sex with men and intra-drug users can spread HIV\AIDS if they are HIV positive. People should be cautious and alert and should opt for protected means when visiting these people. ,Apart from orientation, health department officials also conducted Focus Group Discussion (FGD) among six HIV positive inmates living at Naini central jail. Dr Meesum also added that as many as 11 samples have also been collected from Meerganj locality of the city as health authorities were checking the current status of HIV and AIDS victims in city.,He claimed that only one commercial female sex worker was found HIV positive till last month and she was treated at ART centre in the city. He also claimed that the department was utilising all resources for addressing the HIV\Aids menace. ,All the seven organisations including NGOs are implementing TI (targeted interventions) among the high risk groups in the district covering commercial female sex workers (FSWs), Men Having Sex with Men (MSM) and IDUs (Intra-drug users). ,Meanwhile, Dr VK Srivastava, district programme officer, AIDS control said, ""Effective measures are being taken to achieve the desired results."" He added that officials were stressing more on educational and awareness campaigns."

    The global AIDS epidemic has completed 30 years of its devastating presence in India. This disease has become a chronic manageable disorder now. The country, as per the data provided by NACO, has a high number of AIDS patients. After Maharashtra and other southern states, Uttar Pradesh tooholds a remarkable position as far as the number of AIDS patients isconcerned.
    ,
    ,
    The Combination of zideovudine and Namivudine is having the highest resistance in controlling AIDS. Lopinavir and Ritonavir too can be a good combination to check transfer of AIDS from HIV affected mother to her child. But the combination provided by the doctors in most of the government hospitals in India give dose of Nevirapine which holds least resistance intransfer of AIDS, added Giladia.
    ,
    ,
    He added that if an HIV affected male partner opts for safe sexual measures including intake of the medical combinations he would not be able to pass on HIV virus to his female partner. Also even if both the parents are HIV positive, their child can be saved from getting affected from the deadly disease by using proper medicinal dose.
    ,
    ,
    ""We are observing a continuous increase in the patients suffering from AIDS. Yet what has saved the larger population from HIV is the Indian culture. The responsiveness of country's youth, efforts of NGOs and medical care have contributed a lot in preventing HIV from spreading. But we still have to cover a long way to make the country free from this fatal disease,"" said Dr J K Maniar, president, AIDS Society of India.
    ,
    ,
    Dr S K Katiyar, former principal of GSVM Medical College said that the Aids Society of India works to educate doctors as well as people to treat HIV patients in a healthy way, as in most of the cases AIDS patients die after being rejected by the community and society.

  LONDON: More than 100,000 fresh , cases have been averted over the last five years among the general population in India which has some 2.4 million people living with the virus, according to a study in 'The Lancet' journal.
  
  ,
  This is all thanks to a Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation -funded US dollars 338 million project, called Avahan, which was launched in six Indian states of Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Manipur and Nagaland in 2003.
  ,
  ,
  Avahan was launched for the purpose of reducing the spread of HIV in India and developing a model prevention system to encourage others worldwide to adapt and adopt it.
  ,
  ,
  The project serves the groups that are most vulnerable to HIV infection, including sex workers, their clients, high-risk men who have sex with men, and injecting drug users in the six Indian states with an estimated population of 300 million.
  ,
  ,
  All these six states had the highest prevalences of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in India in 2003, according to the study conducted by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, ,, University of Hong Kong and the Public Health Foundation of India.
  ,
  ,
  The study says interventions like safe-sex counselling by peers, treatment for sexually transmitted infections, distribution of free condoms and needle and syringe exchange programmes among the most-at-risk population prevented the virus from spreading among the general population.
  ,
  ,
  ""Overall, we estimated that 100,178 HIV infections were averted at the population level from 2003 up to 2008 as a result of Avahan,"" the study's author say.
  ,
  ,
  Lead author Prof Lalit Dandona at the PHFI, added: ""HIV mainly spreads in India through sexual intercourse.

There wasn't a very high difference in Tamil Nadu, while there was no significant change in the two northeastern states.""

  NEW DELHI: About 100, 000 fresh HIV cases among the general population were averted in India in five years by targeting the most vulnerable section.
  
  ,
  A study — conducted jointly by the ,, ,, University of Hong Kong and the , (PHFI) — has found that , successfully slowed the transmission of HIV among the general population by raising the coverage of prevention interventions in high-risk groups like female sex workers, their clients and partners, men who have sex with men (MSM), intravenous drug users and truck drivers.
  ,
  ,
  Launched in 2003, Avahan received $258 million from the Bill and ,, and complemented the government's own efforts on HIV prevention. The programme was implemented in four large states — Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu — and two small northeastern states of Manipur and Nagaland.
  ,
  ,
  These six states were estimated to have the highest HIV prevalence in India in 2003, and a total population of 300 million.
  ,
  ,
  The study, ""Assessment of population-level effect of Avahan, an HIV-prevention initiative in India,"" published in the British Medical Journal, The Lancet, says interventions like safe-sex counselling by peers, clinical services like treatment for sexually transmitted infections, distribution of free condoms and needle and syringe exchange programmes among the most-at-risk population prevented the virus from spreading among the general population.
  ,
  ,
  Lead author of the study Professor Lalit Dandona from the PHFI told TOI that HIV mainly spread in India through sexual intercourse. He said, ""High-risk population like sex workers would infect their clients who would then spread it to other female partners like their wives. Similarly, MSMs infected each other and then spread it within the general population through unprotected sex. Avahan showed us that by targeting high-risk groups, the virus spread among the general population can be controlled.""
  ,
  ,
  He added, ""HIV prevalence among the general population saw a significant reduction in Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Maharashtra due to Avahan. There wasn't a very high difference in Tamil Nadu, while there was no significant change in the two northeastern states.""

  GENEVA: India, which has one of the highest populations of HIV-infected people in Asia, has witnessed a decline in new infections by a significant 56% from the epidemic's peak in 1996, with other Asian countries also showing a plunge.
  
  ,
  According to the UNAIDS , report 2011, the number of new , has been falling significantly in Asia, with India leading the pack.
  ,
  ,
  It said new , infections and AIDS-related deaths have fallen by 21% from the peak of the epidemic around world.
  ,
  ,
  The number of people dying of AIDS-related causes fell to 1.8 million in 2010, down from a peak of 2.2 million in the mid-2000s, while a total of 2.5 million deaths have been averted in low- and middle-income countries since 1995 due to antiretroviral therapy being introduced.
  ,
  ,
  ""In South and South-East Asia, the estimated 270,000 new HIV infections in 2010 was 40 per cent less than at the epidemic's peak in 1996,"" said the report.
  ,
  ,
  ""In India, the country with the largest number of people living with HIV in the region, new HIV infections fell by 56 per cent,"" it added.
  ,
  ,
  Releasing the report here, executive director of , Michel Sidibe said the results are satisfactory, but stressed that shared responsibility is needed to combat the epidemic more effectively.
  ,
  ,
  ""Even in a very difficult financial crisis, countries are delivering results in the AIDS response. We have seen a massive scale up in access to HIV treatment which has had a dramatic effect on the lives of people everywhere,"" Sidibe said in a release.

    ,
    ,
    According to the new estimates, 47% (6.6 million) of the estimated 14.2 million people eligible for treatment in low- and middle-income countries were accessing ART in 2010, an increase of 1.35 million since 2009.

What if the person harms himself after finding himself HIV positive but he is actually HIV negative?""
    ,
    ,
    Around 8,000 centres across India counsel people who undertake a HIV test. In 2010, an estimated 6 million people got tested for HIV. ""Counselling is vital.

In case they are found negative, they are counselled on how to stay that way and about safe sex,"" the official said.
    ,
    ,
    However, the UNAIDS report 2011 talks about self-testing. ""Despite the advances in technology, testing is still approached with fear, accessing clinics is inconvenient and the experience of HIV testing is often stigmatizing,"" the report said.
    ,
    ,
    ""A recent national study in Kenya showed only 16% of HIV-infected adults knew that they were infected. A variety of tests, from finger pricks to mouth swabs, can now produce results in 1-20 minutes. The cost of these tests is now measured in cents,"" the report added.
    ,
    ,
    One model, according to UNAIDS, has estimated that up to half of new HIV infections among children are caused by stigma, because women refuse to take tests or fail to collect their results. ""One option to radically shift test access is self-testing at home. Information and support could be provided remotely. Most importantly, those who tested positive would need a clear access path to health care, starting with a confirmatory test. In September 2011, the United Kingdom's House of Lords' select committee on AIDS recommended repealing laws that prohibit home HIV testing,"" the report said.

  ""She is positive that she can serve children like herself by becoming a doctor. The only thing she asks of me is that I eat well and maintain my health,"" says her mother Mangali, who is also HIV positive.

Although official statistics say that out of a total of over 17,664 samples screened till date, only about 80 cases were positive, a little more than 10 were full-blown AIDS cases and a few deaths wer e reported, this could be the tip of the iceberg.
  
  ,
  In fact, there is also a feeling that the state government is still denying that AIDS is an 'issue' in the state. Only the families of people who have suffered from AIDS and felt the pain and trauma related to the disease seem to understand that the disease poses a big threat.

  A rapid assessment survey conducted by the , International Drug Control Programme (UNDCP), the Regional Office for South Asia (ROSA) a few years ago suggested that out of some 320 sample of drug users interviewed in Shillong, 11%, i.e. 36 were female.

  MUMBAI: With the taming of the predominant HIV-1 type, responsible for a majority of the 2.7 million infection cases in the country, experts say it is time to evaluate the incidence and seriousness of the HIV-2 infection. So far, there is little clinical experience or treatment knowledge about the other type of ,. In the absence of clear protocols from , Aids Control Organization (Naco), most clinicians are groping in the dark about the treatment regime to be followed.
  
  ,
  There is an equal amount of confusion in diagnosis for want of appropriate testing kits. While both HIV- 1 and 2 have similar modes of transmission and could cause similar opportunistic infections, the latter takes longer to manifest.
  ,
  ,
  Studies abroad have shown how people have lived near normal lives for decades without showing any symptoms of illness . However, mothers infected with pure HIV-2 can pass on the infection to their newborns. ""Presently, we have nothing very effective to deal with that,"" said a Naco official who did not wish to be named.
  ,
  ,
  In Mumbai, the Anti-Retroviral Treatment (ART) centre at JJ Hospital, earlier headed by Dr Alaka Deshpande, was the first to detect HIV-2 infections, document and treat the cases in the city. ""In the last one year, we have diagnosed around 140 patients with HIV-2 ,"" said Deshpande . She insisted that it was high time the government took cognizance of HIV-2 and start actively studying and monitoring it. ""We are facing a situation where patients could develop resistance ,"" she added.
  ,
  ,
  A study undertaken by doctors at BYL Nair Hospital between January 2007 and December 2009 showed that 140 out of 42,961 patients had HIV-2 infection . Of these, 90 were exclusively HIV-2 infected, whereas the remaining 59 clients were co-infected with HIV- 1 and 2.
  ,
  ,
  The Naco official said efforts to understand HIV-2 have begun . ""Protocols on how to test samples, study viral loads, etc are being worked upon,"" said the Naco officer. Currently, there are no standalone kits widely available to test HIV-2 . Head of the microbiology department at JJ Hospital Dr Ameeta Joshi said that for over a year they have been sending data and samples to the laboratory at the , (NII) at Parel.

  JAIPUR: Ajmer and Udaipur have been identified as high risk places for , infection among the 108 districts in seven states due to high migration of truckers and labourers.
  
  ,
  From December 15, the National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) will assist , (RSACS) to launch a campaign in these two districts to create awareness about theme of , 'Getting to Zero' -- zero new HIV infections, zero discrimination and zero AIDS related deaths.
  ,
  ,
  The central government has sent a report to the medical, health and family welfare department informing that since these two districts receive high migration of labourers and truckers due to the presence of mines and other mining related industries, the risk of HIV infection remains at an elevated level.
  ,
  ,
  Recently, WHO's regional advisor Dr Iyanthi Abeywicrame, who was in Jaipur, had pointed out that there are many factors for this high risk status.
  ,
  ,
  He had said that people from Rajasthan migrate to high prevalence states like Maharashtra and Gujarat and some of them come home infected. Another reason is that the state is home to 19% of all mines in India, employing over 5 lakh migrant workers. Also, everyday 25,000 truckers travel through Rajasthan. The prevalence of HIV is very high among the truckers.
  ,
  ,
  Health minister A A Khan said, ""Our efforts are to bring the numbers to zero by 2015 and we are working on to achieve the target.""
  ,
  ,
  In Jaipur and Udaipur, NRHM would assist the RSACS to spread the awareness by launching a campaign with Red Ribbon buses from December 15.
  ,
  ,
  Joint director of information education and communication Pradeep Choudhary said, ""We will hold camps in the interior areas of the districts where primary health centres are quite far away.""
  ,
  ,
  Ajmer chief medical and health officer Dr Laxman Harchandani said, ""In Ajmer there are 1,650 people living with HIV. Since, there are large numbers of truckers and labourers coming to the district, there is always a risk of HIV infection spread. So, the National Aids Control Society has selected Ajmer for Red Ribbon buses.""

    The 6 lakh women deliver in private hospitals, which, activists say, are not very cooperative about HIV testing. In contrast, public sector hospitals conduct HIV tests on the 14 lakh pregnant women who are admitted there for delivery. The total number of pregnant women who deliver in the state each year is 21 lakh.
    ,
    ,
    The state says achieving HIV testing for 100% of pregnant woman is a distant possibility. This is because over 1,150 primary health centres and sub-centres still do not have any testing facilities. Such centres witness 7 lakh deliveries, but manage to test only about 50,000 women. Mumbai fares better than , of the state as the testing percentage is over 80.

  The , (MSACS) wants the government and AIDS activists to ""do something"" to make pre-marital HIV screening socially acceptable.
  
  ,
  Statistics for recent years show that 75% of the state's , are under 25 and 50% are detected with the virus only at the time of their first delivery. At present, national policy allows only voluntary testing.
  ,
  ,
  ""It is more than evident that the women are getting the infection from their husbands, "" said Ramesh D ev k a r, MSACS project director. Lending credibility to this is a study published in the Journal of American Medical Association in 1997 by a researcher from Pune's National Aids Research Institute, which put the percentage of women getting HIV from their husbands at 92.
  ,
  ,
  ""We have to work towards a societal norm where couples insist on testing before tying the knot. Of course, making testing legal is not an option,"" Devkar said. This year, 2,027 pregnant women in the rest of Maharashtra and 385 in Mumbai tested positive for HIV. Over the years, the number in the state has gone down: from 4,783 in 2006, to 4,552, 4,162, 3,724 and 3,361 in subsequent years. This year, the number is 2,412 (till October). But the number is still around 3,000. ""That means the birth of at least 2,000 HIV-positive children. That is how high the probability of a child getting the infection from the mother is,"" said Devkar.

  ,
  ""The debate is between discrimination and the possibility of saving two lives."" Many infected women support premarital HIV testing. Kurla resident Ananda (38; name changed) said: ""I have faced the stigma of living with HIV for 11 years. My husband passed away a few years ago. I was ostracized by my in-laws to the extent that they did not allow me to meet my son for two years. I got his custody only after my mother-in-law died. Both I and my child would have been spared such a horrible life had pre-marital testing been mandatory.""

However, the woman, who was employed as a sweeper in a private nursing home in Vadipatti near Madurai, hid her HIV condition from her daughter's in-laws.

  AHMEDABAD/JUNAGADH: The , directed police on Thursday to register an FIR in the case of 23 thalassaemic children being given HIV-infected blood during transfusion in Junagadh.
  
  ,
  Parents of the infected children had approached the high court demanding directions to the cops to investigate negligence by the , authorities. Advocate Girish Das has also filed a PIL demanding investigation and Rs 5 lakh compensation for the affected children and their families.
  ,
  ,
  The 23 children came to know that they had been infected with HIV about six months ago when they went for routine check-ups. They were part of a group of 100 children from across Junagadh district, who came to the civil hospital for blood transfusion regularly.
  ,
  ,
  The state government filed an affidavit before the court on Thursday, stating the children might have contracted the infection at non-licensed laboratories where they may have gone for blood transfusion.
  ,
  ,
  Acting chief justice Bhaskar Bhattacharya disagreed with the government's contention and asked its lawyers to file another affidavit with the documents to support the claim. The kids have been infected with a serious disease and the matter needs to be investigated, the court said.
  ,
  ,
  The parents have demanded that the accused be booked for culpable homicide and causing injury by administering stupefy-ing drug or poison with intent to cause harm.
  ,
  ,
  ""We have told the court that the police has not even registered an FIR despite complaints by the parents,"" said advocate Rajesh Dewal, representing the parents.
  ,
  ,
  The petitioners also demanded that the state government should cancel the licence of the blood bank from where the infected blood was sourced. The court, however, said it will decide on the issue only after the government files its final report.
  ,
  ,
  The angry parents joined the Congress' Satkarma fast against chief minister Narendra Modi's Sadbhavana mission fast at Junagadh on Thursday. ""If the CM really wants to show some sadbhavana, these kids are waiting for it. They have been demanding compensation from the state government but no one had the time for them. Finally, their parents had to move the high court for justice,'' said Girish Kotecha, Congress leader and deputy mayor of Junagadh.

  NEW DELHI: Could an antibody from the blood of an Indian HIV patient help create the elusive ,? (Antibody is an infection-fighting protein produced by our immune system when it detects harmful substances).
  
  ,
  The hunt has begun to identify 100 volunteers belonging to a rare group of HIV infected patients who stay healthy for years without requiring life-saving antiretroviral treatment (ART). These antibodies in their blood are the ones that bars HIV from entering their blood cells and replicating, thereby progressing to AIDS.
  ,
  ,
  Scientists say these antibodies would ultimately reveal the Achilles heel of the virus and help create the elusive vaccine. This is part of International Aids Vaccine Initiative's (IAVI) programme called Protocol G, a global hunt for such antibodies launched in 2006.
  ,
  ,
  So far, blood samples of 1,800 such HIV patients have been screened across 12 countries and 19 broadly neutralizing antibody (bNAbs) have been identified. A bNAb is an antibody capable of stopping a variety of HIV subtypes from infecting their target cells.
  ,
  ,
  ""Only a minority of people who are infected with HIV produce bNAbs. Although HIV is a wildly mutable virus, certain parts of it are relatively resistant to change. These parts are essential to the virus's ability to infect, and they are the elements of HIV that bNAbs target,"" experts said.
  ,
  ,
  Just a few weeks ago, department of biotechnology (DBT) cleared the proposal to roll out Protocol G in the country. It is being implemented by IAVI and YRG Care from Chennai - the same organization that isolated the first HIV case in India in 1986.
  ,
  ,
  The blood samples collected from the 100 volunteers will be tested at Translational Health Sciences and Technology Institute (THSTI), which is being built in Gurgaon.
  ,
  ,
  IAVI's India chief Dr Rajat Goyal told TOI that ""This is a landmark project for India. We are presently identifying volunteers, who are at least 18 years, infected with HIV at least three years ago but has not received ART. By April, samples will be picked up and tested against a standard panel of HIV isolates by the end of 2012. We will then know whether there is a population of interest from whom these bNAb can be identified and characterized.""
  ,
  ,
   , study of bNAbs is expected to reveal vulnerabilities of the different types of HIV. Most importantly, scientists expect that they can use information about how bNAbs bind to HIV to construct immunogens — the active ingredients of vaccines — that elicit similar antibodies. The more such antibodies researchers have in hand, the more clues they can get about how best to target HIV with a vaccine.
  ,
  ,
  The project has tested HIV patients in ,, the UK, the US, Nigeria, South ,, ,, ,, ,, Australia and , to identify bNAbs.
  ,
  ,
  HIV infects 7,100 people daily. The quest to develop an AIDS vaccine has consumed scientists for 25 years since the discovery of HIV. Scientists say HIV is the most mutable virus ever encountered. A number of different subtypes of the virus, known as clades, circulate in different regions of the world. Within those clades there is considerable variability, and, beyond that, the virus mutates furiously within the people it has infected.
  ,
  ,
  Second, because no one is known to have cleared an HIV infection, scientists do not know which elements of the immune response must be engaged to control the virus — and thus are uncertain how to replicate such responses.
  ,
  ,
  The immune system has a very narrow window of opportunity in which to neutralize HIV before the virus establishes a lifelong infection.

"Updated: Jan 12, 2012, 06:10 IST,Studies on the relationship between migration and HIV conducted by NACO in three popular migration corridors &... ",HIV 10 times more prevalent among migrants than general population,"

  NEW DELHI: Migration is fuelling India's , epidemic. ,'s latest figures show that besides high risk populations like sex workers, the highest burden of HIV is among , — 3.6%, which is 10 times the HIV prevalence among the general population.
  
  ,
  With migration rates increasing, the prevalence will only get worse. According to the 2001 census, 30.1% of the population was considered to have migrated (314 million) — a considerable increase from 27.4% in 1991. NACO has, therefore, identified 108 railway stations - which are both source and destination of migrants travelling in search of work. These are now the focus of the country's anti-HIV fight.
  ,
  ,
  Red Ribbon Express (RRE), which chugs out of Delhi on Thursday, will stop at most of these 108 identified stations to test migrants for HIV besides carrying out counselling and spreading anti-HIV messages. During it's year-long journey, RRE will traverse through 23 states, cover 30,000 km and stop at 162 stations.
  ,
  ,
  Speaking to TOI, a NACO official said, ""Migrants are one of the major focus areas this time with the RRE. Last year, RRE stopped at 152 stations and reached out to 8 million people directly. This time, around 30-40 stops will be to mainly address migrants.""
  ,
  ,
  NACO has identified 122 districts with high out-migration across 11 states which are on priority for starting up community level interventions. Another 75 important transit locations have been identified across these 122 districts from where these migrants usually board long distance trains/buses to reach their destinations.
  ,
  ,
  Studies on the relationship between migration and HIV conducted by NACO in three popular migration corridors — Ganjam-Surat, Darbhanga-Delhi and Azamgarh-Mumbai — threw up shocking findings. It showed that two to four times more number of informal workers had non-regular partners or visited sex workers with only 25% using condoms. Around 5% male migrants and 13% female migrants reported sexually transmitted infections, nearly double , average.
  ,
  ,
  According to NACO, the risk of HIV infection for migrants seems to arise from a multitude of factors -- risky behaviour, lack of social and economic security and involvement in peer driven risk taking activities.
  ,
  ,
  In a recent study by UNDP (through Population Council), the risk of HIV among migrants was reported to be 1.68 times more likely than non-migrants. Majority of migrants are also often poorly educated, with majority reporting less than five years of formal education. This contributes to limited knowledge of ,.
  ,
  ,
  A study conducted in 30 villages in the northern parts of Karnataka revealed that 40% of single men and 35% of married migrant men had non-marital sexual relationships in the last 12 months.
  ,
  ,
  For a long time, India has lived with the belief that migrants are at risk only at destination sites when they are away from home and their spouse. However, recent evidence proves otherwise. Returned migrants continue to fuel the epidemic since most infected migrants tend to return to source when they are sick.
  ,
  ,
  A study of married men found returned migrants were 3.86 times as likely to be HIV positive as compared to active married migrant men. Among men reporting sex with a non-spousal unpaid female sex partner in the past year, only 19% of men reported consistent condom use. This impacts the , and spouses of informal workers/migrants at the source, making them vulnerable to infections from their husband.
  ,
  ,
  RRE has been recognized as the world's largest mass mobilization drive on HIV. Last year, around 80 lakh people were reached through the train and outreach activities.
  ,
  ,
  Around 81,000 district resource persons were trained, 36,000 people got themselves tested for HIV and 28,000 people received general health check-up services.
  ,
  ,
  Impact assessment of RRE indicated that the comprehensive knowledge of routes of HIV transmission, methods of prevention, condom use, STI prevention and treatment was significantly higher among respondents exposed to the RRE project compared to those not exposed.

The idea is to tell students to wait till they are old enough to experiment. In India, generally parents and teachers are shy to discuss such topics with children.

    Dr Solomon said that often when she interacts with schoolchildren, their teachers leave the room.

    She has been conducting such awareness programmes in schools. ""Most of the children hadn't seen a condom. I tell them all about it and also how to use it. I am not encouraging them to have sex. In fact, I tell them to delay or abstain. If they don't listen to what I say, they will at least know to be safe,"" she said.

    Sex education is a prickly subject despite Unicef spelling out the course module. Dr Solomon said the decline in prevalence of the viral infection had slackened international funding and the National AIDS Control Organization's programmes.

    Many NGOs have developed helplines and web-based services as cost-effective ways to reach out to adolescents. ""But we need to shed inhibitions and be open to strengthen our battle against HIV/AIDS,"" said Dr Solomon.

After releasing the 13th , XIII for 2011, experts in the field said that awareness among the public had gone up but awareness without misconception was low.
  
  ,
  Many believe that healthy-looking people have a good immune system and may not test positive for HIV/AIDS. Doctors have been trying to tell people that antiretroviral drugs — the medicines of choice for HIV/AIDS — will only keep the viral load low, but many assume they are safe after taking them. ""We require schemes to target misconceptions. Only awareness without misconceptions will strengthen the fight against ,,"" said AIDS Prevention And Control (APAC) project director Dr Bimal Charles.
  ,
  ,
  Dr Charles said that in the surveys, people had said cleaning the vagina with vinegar or having sex with monkeys would keep out the infection.
  ,
  ,
  The annual survey report, by APAC project along with Tamil Nadu State AIDS Control Society (TANSACS) and USAID, has been prepared since 1996. The survey is conducted among high-risk groups like female sex workers, gays and injecting drug users and bridge population groups such as truckers and migrant workers.
  ,
  ,
  With a sample size of 5,000, the field work was done in November and December 2011 across 15 towns in Tamil Nadu. The results showed a significant improvement in the behaviour among targeted groups where NGOs were working.
  ,
  ,
  Most field workers had reasons to smile: condom use among female sex workers had gone up from 95.7% to 98.5%; 96.1% of gays reported using condoms during sex with commercial partners, 91% of gays reported taking HIV test in the last one year; the proportion of Injecting Drug Users (IDUs) who reported sharing needles and syringes with their partners reduced from 43.3% in the last round of BSS to 31.6% in the current round; and a lesser number of truckers (28.5%) reported seeking services of commercial sex workers when compared to earlier survey (45.1%).
  ,
  ,
  But there is still a need for improvement. For instance, though condom use is high among casual and regular clients, it remains low among regular partners; many counselling services aren't adequately used; and the changing patterns of sex workers have excluded some women from the intervention programmes.

  ,
  State government officials and the Mumbai District AIDS Control Society (MDACS) are tight-lipped about the co-infection case. A source said: ""The patient is yet to be started on antiretroviral therapy (ART) for HIV infection. Such patients are usually treated for TB at the beginning. Once they stabilize, ART is started.""
  ,
  ,
  TB is the commonest HIV-related opportunistic infection. An expert summed up the deadly nature of the combined infection saying that when HIV brings down immunity, TB catches up. ""The two need to be dealt with in a synchronized manner. Efforts and the machinery to integrate the , (RNTCP) with the HIV programme need to be strengthened.""
  ,
  ,
  As per norm, patients received by registered TB centres are counselled to go for HIV testing and vice versa. Since HIV testing is voluntary, many give it a miss. Doctors say TB patients are often not counselled enough to understand the importance of HIV testing.
  ,
  ,
  According to data compiled by the Maharashtra State AIDS Control Society (MSACS), out of 1.01 lakh registered TB patients, only 40,202, or 39%, were referred to Integrated Counselling and Testing Centres (ICTCs) for HIV testing in 2011 till September. Among them, 1,678 patients tested positive for HIV. In Mumbai, the prevalence of HIV among TB patients is 7-8%.

  Dr S S Kudalkar of MDACS said mortality among patients suffering from both infections has halved in recent years. ""Till a few years ago, the mortality rate (among HIV-TB co-infection patients) was around 8%. Now it is 4%.""

  He said HIV patients with TB ""probably have a higher risk of recurrence and death"". ""At no point can these patients afford to discontinue their treatments as that could give rise to (drug) resistance.""

  ,
  ,
  ""A lot of research on viruses , especially HIV, is aimed at trying to understand what the body's mechanisms of resistance are and then to understand how the virus has gotten around these mechanisms,"" said team member Nathaniel R Landau in the 'Nature Immunology' journal.

  The research focused on a protein called SAMHD1. Recent studies have found that immune cells, called dendritic cells, containing the protein are resistant to infection by HIV. But it was not clear till now how it works to protect these cells.
  ,
  ,
  Now, Landau and his colleagues are able to provide an answer: When a virus, like HIV, infects a cell, it hijacks the cell's molecular material to replicate. That molecular material is in the form of deoxynucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs), which are the building blocks for ,.

  Once the virus replicates, the resulting DNA molecule contains all the genes of the virus and instructs the cell to make more virus.

  A study, conducted by Dr Stefan Baral from the Center for Public Health and Human Rights at Johns Hopkins' ,, to be published by the Lancet on Thursday shows that FSWs in developing countries are 14 times more likely to be infected by HIV than women in the general population.
  ,
  ,
  The authors carried out an analysis of 102 studies, representing almost 100,000 FSWs in 50 countries. Overall, HIV prevalence in FSWs was found to be 12%.
  ,
  ,
  In 26 countries deemed to have medium or high background HIV prevalence, some 31% of FSWs were HIV- positive, and were 12 times more likely to be infected than women from the general population.
  ,
  ,
  ""We identified consistent evidence of substantially higher levels of HIV among FSWs compared with all women of reproductive age in low and middle-income countries in all regions with data,"" the authors said.
  ,
  ,
  ""These findings suggest an urgent need to scale up access to quality HIV-prevention programming and services among FSWs because of their heightened burden of disease and likelihood of onward transmission through high numbers of sexual partners as clients. Improvement of linkages to antiretroviral treatment and retention in care is crucial. The role of stigma, discrimination and violence targeting female sex workers globally will be required to reduce the disproportionate disease burden among these women,"" they added.
  ,
  ,
  ""When reviewing the data from the past five years, FSWs still carry more than a 50-time increased odds of HIV infection in India. Since HIV prevalence is a lagging indicator of prevention success, time is needed to reveal the benefit of these programmes in terms of the absolute burden of HIV among female sex workers in India. Nonetheless, the disproportionate burden of HIV among these sex workers, even in settings where progressive programmes exist, emphasizes the need to increase coverage by increasing scale of prevention programmes and decreasing barriers to access,"" is how The Lancet summed about the situation in India.
  ,
  ,
  In India, women account for around one million out of 2.5 million estimated number of people living with HIV/AIDS. The National , Control Organization estimates that around 4.9% of FSWs in India are HIV- positive.
  ,
  ,
  The estimated number of new annual HIV infections has declined by more than 50% over the past decade. India had about 1.2 lakh new HIV infections in 2009 as against 2.7 lakh in 2000.
  ,
  ,
  While this trend is evident in most states, some low prevalence states have shown an increase in the number of new infections over the past two years. Of the 1.2 lakh estimated new infections in 2009, the six high-prevalence states account for only 39% of the cases, while states like Odisha, Bihar, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat account for 41% of new infections.
  ,
  ,
  The adult HIV prevalence at national level has continued its steady decline from estimated level of 0.41% in 2000 through 0.36% in 2006 to 0.31% in 2009. In India, about 40% people don't even know their HIV status.
  ,
  ,
  The prevalence of HIV among key population at higher risk of infection - notably sex workers, people who inject drugs and men who have sex with men - is high in several Asian countries. However, the virus is spreading to other sections of the population through the years.

  MUMBAI: Over 450 HIV patients have been waiting endlessly for the advanced anti-retroviral therapy to start, courtesy bureaucratic tardiness. For more than three months, patients are struggling without treatment as the first line of therapy is not effective to keep the viral load under control.
  
  ,
  The problem has compounded for patients as the JJ Hospital's Centre of Excellence remains one of the nodal centres in the state to screen and select patients for second line of anti-retroviral therapy (ART).
  ,
  ,
  Patients who become resistant to the first line of ART treatment, and have a viral load of more than 5,000 copies per millilitre, have to be started on the second line. Patients are also dependant on the free second line ART treatment as it could cost about Rs 10,000 in a month.
  ,
  ,
  A medical source told TOI said the problems started soon after former ART in-charge Dr Alaka Deshpande quit in November 2011. ""Monthly meetings, which were held to select patients after their viral load examinations were done, just stopped. Without those meetings the patients could not be selected,"" said a JJ Hospital source.
  ,
  ,
  Dr BB Rewari, National Aids Control Organization (NACO) ART consultant, said, ""There was no new doctor trained to replace the previous nodal person. The new team headed by Dr V K Joglekar has requested us to sensitize them about the ART. We will be doing that soon."" he said. Rewari also said that not more than 100 patients would be affected because of the delay. ""Two centres in Aurangabad and Pune have commenced operations to take the load off the JJ Hospital staff. Nagpur will also have another centre soon for second line therapy,"" he said.
  ,
  ,
  However, some doctors at JJ Hospital defended themselves by saying that lack of training alone should not be blamed for the delay.
  ,
  ,
  ""The testing facility to check viral load had stopped, however tests have resumed,"" said one of the doctors. Sources told TOI that medical kits required for testing viral load were out of stock, and so the laboratory at Kasturba Hospital could not carry out the tests.

Shunned by his wife, the man was desperate for sexual relief from his lover with whom he was in relationship for around three years. The mistress roped in three young neighbours with a promise to pay Rs 70,000 to eliminate the man for ever.

Anita's husband had passed away around five years ago. Purke did not have a cordial relation with his family members and often stayed out. He also stayed with Anita on a number of occasions at her place.
  ,

  Police said that Anita was given a lot of money by Purke. She had also kept his bike. Soon, however, there was a breakdown in the relationship. Learning about Purke's relationship with Anita, his family member thrashed her. She reported the matter to the police and got Purke's parents and siblings booked for attempt to murder in 2010.

  Police said Purke's health became the prime issue of discord between Anita and him. She contacted Kishore and sought his help in eliminating Purke. Kishore roped in Tejram and Mukesh. She even brought them to Shantinagar where Purke resided so that they could identity their victim.

  PUNE: The medical expenses incurred by families who have at least one HIV positive member are a serious strain on their finances, pushing many of them into a ""poverty trap"".
  
  ,
  This was revealed in a field survey of 401 such families in the city, undertaken by the Gokhale Institute of Politics and Economics (GIPE) to gauge the economic profile of People Living with HIV (PLHIV) and the socio-economic impact of HIV at the household level.
  ,
  ,
  The families surveyed are registered with a city NGO, which works towards providing socio-psycho, legal support and counselling to PLHIV. Though the study included households from all strata of society, and from varied economic backgrounds, nearly 50% of the sample group was from the lower economic categories. The study was completed under the guidance of Sanjeevanee Mulay, former associate professor at GIPE.
  ,
  ,
  Varun Sharma, who undertook the study, is a former senior research fellow at GIPE and currently assistant professor at the , (IHMR) in Bangalore. He said the study was an attempt to estimate the relationship between HIV prevalence and poverty. ""We cannot overlook the fact that PLHIV from the lower socio-economic background, especially from the slum areas in cities like Pune, are most vulnerable. This should be considered while drafting policies and programmes concerning HIV,"" he said.
  ,
  ,
  Sharma said the study used economic methods such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Standard of Living Index (SLI). Based on these two indices, the study found that families with HIV+ persons are more destitute compared to other families. ""This is especially true of households run by HIV+ women. The study revealed that 70% of the sample households managed by women have a middle socio-economic status whereas about 50% of them can be categorised as the 'poorest of the poor'. In comparison, only 30% of households run by men fit in the category. The reason for this may be that, in general, a woman's income is less than that of a man,"" he said. The study revealed that though anti-retroviral therapy (ART) for treating HIV is free at the public health centres, HIV+ people have to spend from their own pockets on other illnesses and ailments which come with the HIV infection, Sharma said. ""The economic burden is more on those who are already poor, and it leads to medical poverty trap. In the analysis, we found that there is a sharp increase of 20% BPL headcounts, when adjusted for out-of-pocket health spending,"" he said.
  ,
  ,
  HIV+ people from the upper and middle socio-economic backgrounds usually opt for private health facilities, which are better, and also because it offers them a privacy.
  ,
  ,
  Sharma said a comparison between the families surveyed and the city's non-HIV urban households (surveyed under the national reproductive and child health programme) confirmed that a majority of PLHIV households either came from the lower economic strata of society or had gradually become impoverished over a period of time. According to the study, 36.9% households with HIV+ members had a low standard of living.
  ,
  ,
  Sanjeevani Kulkarni, coordinator, ,, which treats more than 3,500 , patients from the city and other parts of the country at its ,, said special focus on widowed women diagnosed with HIV is needed.

  ,
    23-year-old tattoo artist Veer (name changed) recently discovered that he was suffering from AIDS. Unable to cope with his rapidly falling health, the lad just stopped taking medicines and finally committed suicide a few days back.
    ,
    ,
    Along with being HIV positive, these two men had another thing in common - both of them were closet gays and hadn't declared their sexuality to their families. So, what needs to be done to contain these suicides in the gay community? We try to find the answers...
    ,
    ,
    ,
    ,
    Film director Onir of films like I AM and My Brother Nikhil fame, who's openly declared his sexuality, says: ""It's the burden of dealing with the dual stigma (of , and HIV), which proves to be their undoing. Gays won't reveal their sexuality without fear till the time Supreme Court gives a ruling in their favour. Meanwhile, sex education will go a long way in educating them about safe sex. ,' support can safeguard them against societal cruelty and mockery, which eggs them on to take the ultimate step. They must not force their kids to get married against their wish. It is enough that their child is happy with a partner of his own choice. This acceptance can lessen such sad incidents!""
    ,
    ,
    ,
    ,
    According to Prince ,, India's first gay royal to declare his sexuality, being a part of a support group goes a long way in lessening the psychological burden of HIV-inflicted gays. ""If they interact regularly with like-minded people and share their fears, their goals and their woes with other HIV-positive people, they feel much better and stronger from within. But, if they remain closet gays, nobody can help them. There's nobody to hold their hand and wipe their tears when danger signals appear,"" says he.
  
  ,
  ,
    ,
    ,
    ""Two years back, I learnt that I was HIV positive, and tried to commit suicide thrice since then. But, whenever I went to jump into a well, the faces of my parents would come in front of me, and I would step back. My parents are now pressurising me to get married, and I am scared of telling them about my homosexuality, as I'm already trying to cope with my HIV.""
    ,
    ,
    ,
    ,
    ""I have known for the past four years that I'm HIV positive. Last year, I told my mom about it and she was shocked initially. But now, she's become my biggest support and that helps. Hope, some day I can gather enough guts to tell her about my homosexuality too!""
    ,
    ,
    ,
    ,
    ""I'm married and have a two-year-old daughter too. Barely 15 days back, I learnt about my HIV status and was scared to death. On, the counsellor's advice, I had to tell my wife about it. She wept and threatened to leave me, but finally agreed to stay on. I don't think I will be able to tell her about my homosexuality now because I'm scared that she'll leave me!""

In less than a year, the couple had to shift at least five rented premises after house owners found they are HIV positive.

"Bushra Baseerat,Updated: May 14, 2012, 01:55 IST",HIV on decline as Andhra Pradesh climbs to 4th spot in condoms usage,"

  HYDERABAD: , has seen a 100% rise in usage of condoms in the last four years and is now the highest consumer of condoms among the four southern states and the fourth highest in the country. The rise in condom usage has brought down the , prevalence in the state significantly among its high risk group population.
  
  ,
  The 7.5 crore free condoms that were supplied for the high risk groups got exhausted much before the end of the year and the state had to request the , government to donate their leftover 60 lakh condoms in March. Seeing the massive response, the , (Naco) has added to AP's quota of condoms and will now ship 10.9 crore condoms this year.
  ,
  ,
  The authorities are attributing the substantial drop in the HIV prevalence rate to the increased condom usage. As per the survey conducted by AP State Aids Control Society (Apsacs) and Naco, that is being finalized, the HIV prevalence among female sex workers has dropped from 11% in 2008 to 7% now. The highest decline was noted among the Men having Sex with Men (MSMs) community wherein from 23%, the incidence plummeted to 10%. Among the Injectable Drug Users (IDUs), the incidence has declined from 7% to 3%. The sexually transmitted infections too have seen a drastic drop.
  ,
  ,
  Officials say that till about four years ago, the situation was so dismal that lakhs of condoms were wasted, having crossed their expiry dates because of no takers. But today, Apsacs is struggling to ensure that shortages don't crop up. ""People have become more health conscious now and they are also seeking the services of the integrated counseling and testing centres. This is a healthy trend,"" says T Kailashditya, joint director, targeting interventions, Apsacs. He added that Uttar Pradesh tops the country in condom usage and is followed by ,, Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh.
  ,
  ,
  Apsacs has been selling condoms at a subsidized rate to several sections such as truckers. Last year, 1.5 crore condoms were marketed like this for this population apart from the 7.5 crore free condoms doled out to the high risk groups. ""The situation is such that we have to plan a month in advance for the supply to avoid a shortage,"" said the official.
  ,
  ,
  Besides, condoms are being lapped up over the counters by the general population. Experts said that factors such as education, benefits of condom use and perceived infection risk are also playing an important role. They added that after five years of effort, the demand for condoms has gone up and the HIV prevalence rate has shown a decline. However, the state still has the highest number of people (5 lakh) living with , in the country.

  Doctors generally hesitate before performing any kind of complicated surgeries on HIV positive or clinical , because their immune systems are usually highly compromised. ""It's risky. If the vein near the food pipe gets damaged, it's almost instant death. This new tube itself may develop a leak, which could lead to death. They are highly prone to infections and the patient finds it difficult to recover post-surgery,"" said Dr J S Rajkumar of Lifeline.

  The procedure was done by making three holes on the side of the chest, four holes in the abdomen and a cut in the neck. ""We inserted the thoracolaparascopic equipment inside, removed the damaged esophagus, and then separated the layers of the stomach, and pulled out a part of it, to make a tube out of it, and tied it up at the neck,"" said Dr Rajkumar.

  Ravirajan was diagnosed with HIV in 2000. Five years ago, his food pipe almost closed. He could not take solid food. ""My throat would get blocked even if I had porridge.

  For the overall reduction in the epidemic, targeted interventions are aimed to effect behaviour change through raising awareness among the high risk groups. It has been researched that truckers are a critical group. Their living and working conditions, sexually active age and separation from regular partners for extended periods of time predispose them to paid sex or sex with non-regular partners. ""These interventions build awareness among the spouses of truckers and migrant workers, women aged 15 to 49 and children affected by HIV or vulnerable population groups,"" said Dr Gupta.

  NEW DELHI: A new once-daily pill combining three , (ARTs) and a booster molecule has been found to be safe and effective alternative to two widely used drug regimens for newly diagnosed HIV-positive adults, who have had no previous treatment.
  
  ,
  The findings of two large international randomized trials to be published on Friday's Lancet says the new ""Quad"" pill is faster acting, doesn't have the neuropsychiatric side-effects associated with other combinations, and could improve compliance with treatment.
  ,
  ,
  Patient adherence to medication is vital, especially for patients with ,, where missed doses can quickly lead to the virus becoming resistant to medication.
  ,
  ,
  Older HIV treatment regimens involve taking several pills multiple times a day. Paul Sax from Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, lead author of the first study, said, ""Our results provide an additional highly potent, well-tolerated treatment option and highlight the simplicity of treatment resulting from combining several antiretrovirals in a single pill.""
  ,
  ,
  Sax said studies have shown that single pill treatments improve both adherence and patient satisfaction and help prevent prescription errors, helping reducing the likelihood of treatment failure and drug resistance.
  ,
  ,
  The first trial randomly assigned 700 patients from centres across North America to start treatment with two different single tablet regimens — either Quad, combining the new integrase inhibitor elvitegravir (EVG) boosted with cobicistat (a new pharmacoenhancer COBI) plus FTC/TDF, or a gold standard regimen approved by the FDA in 2006, combining EFV/FTC/TDF (also known as Atripla).
  ,
  ,
  After 48 weeks of treatment, 88% of patients given Quad suppressed viral loads to undetectable levels (less than 50 copies per mL of blood), compared with 84% in the EFV/FTC/TDF group.
  ,
  ,
  Adverse events that led to patients discontinuing treatment were infrequent and similar in both groups.
  ,
  ,
  Mild nausea was more common with Quad, but patients were less likely to have dizziness, abnormal dreams, insomnia, and rash compared with the EFV/FTC/TDF regimen.
  ,
  ,
  The second trial included 708 treatment-naive adults from 146 medical centres across Australia, Europe, North America and Thailand. Patients were randomly assigned to receive once-daily Quad or a popular and recommended twice-daily combination of ritonavir-boosted atazanavir (ATV/RTV) plus FTC/TDF.
  ,
  ,
  The primary endpoint, to achieve viral levels below 50 copies per mL of blood by week 48, was reached by 90% of people in the Quad group compared with 87% in the ATV/RTV/FTC/TDF group.
  ,
  ,
  The safety of the two regimens was also similar with only 3.7% of patients stopping treatment in the Quad group and 5.1% of patients in the ATV/RTV/FTC/TDF group.
  ,
  ,
  If approved by regulatory agencies, the Quad would be the first once-daily single-tablet regimen containing an HIV integrase inhibitor.
  ,
  ,
  Administration of multiple pills and management of additional prescriptions increases complexity, costs for patients, and the chances of poor or partial adherence. For regimens of the same efficacy, total pill burden and dosing frequency are some of the most significant obstacles to achieving high adherence.
  ,
  ,
  ""The EVG/COBI/FTC/TDF single-tablet regimen is undergoing regulatory review; if approved, it would provide an important new treatment option as the only once-daily, integrase-inhibitor-based, single-tablet regimen for initial treatment of patients with HIV,"" the study added.

  NEW DELHI: Now, HIV can be tested in the privacy of your home.
  
  ,
  The , (,) on Wednesday approved the first over-the-counter , that allows people to test at home to see whether they are infected with the virus that causes AIDS.
  ,
  ,
  The , is designed to allow individuals to collect an oral fluid sample by swabbing the upper and lower gums inside of their mouths, then place that sample into a developer vial and obtain test results within 20-40 minutes.
  ,
  ,
  However, a positive result with this test does not mean that an individual is definitely infected with HIV, but rather that additional testing should be done in a medical setting to confirm the result.
  ,
  ,
  Similarly, a negative test result does not mean that an individual is definitely not infected with HIV, particularly when exposure may have been within the previous three months.
  ,
  ,
  FDA says the test has the potential to identify large numbers of previously undiagnosed HIV infections, especially if used by those unlikely to use standard screening methods.
  ,
  ,
  ""Knowing your status is an important factor in the effort to prevent the spread of HIV,"" said Karen Midthun, director of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research. ""The availability of a home-use HIV test kit provides another option for individuals to get tested so that they can seek medical care, if appropriate.""
  ,
  ,
  However, India is not going to allow home testing of this deadly infection. India's National AIDS Control Organization (,) told TOI that counseling patients before and after they undergo testing is vital.
  ,
  ,
  ""If patients find themselves HIV positive by testing at home without counseling, it can push them to suffer from severe depression, make them commit suicide or lead to violence if women are found to be positive. Around 35% of all new cases of HIV in India are among women India. Such home testing kits can be allowed in countries with high infection rates in the general population and not in India where the epidemic is concentrated among high risk populations like sex workers,"" said national ART officer at NACO Dr B B Rewari.
  ,
  ,
  Union health ministry officials said at present nearly 10,000 centres across India counsel people who undertake a HIV test. In 2011, an estimated 1.6 million people got tested for HIV. Around 2.31 million people are estimated to be HIV positive in India.
  ,
  ,
  ""Of these, 40% don't know that they are infected. Counseling is vital. We tell those who get tested and are found HIV positive how to lead a healthy life, how we will connect them to care, support and treatment services, put them on nutritional support and prevent further spread of the virus,"" Dr Rewari added.
  ,
  ,
  Dr Sandhya Kabra from NACO said, whenever a patient is found to be HIV positive, the test is repeated two more times to confirm the results.
  ,
  ,
  ""If found negative, the test isn't repeated. But if the test gives a positive result, we repeat the test for extra confirmation. Testing without counseling can make a patient take drastic measures,"" Dr Kabra said.
  ,
  ,
  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that there are about 50,000 new HIV infections every year. Many of these new infections are transmitted from people who are unaware of their HIV status.
  ,
  ,
  Clinical studies for self-testing have shown that the OraQuick In-Home HIV Test has an expected performance of 92% for test sensitivity, the percentage of results that will be positive when HIV is present. This means that one false negative result would be expected out of every 12 test results in HIV-infected individuals.
  ,
  ,
  Clinical studies also have shown that the OraQuick In-Home HIV Test has an expected performance of 99.98% for test specificity, the percentage of results that will be negative when HIV is not present.
  ,
  ,
  This means that one false positive would be expected out of every 5,000 test results in uninfected individuals.
  ,
  ,
  A variety of home tests finger pricks or mouth swabs are now being developed to be used by individuals to know their HIV status by sitting at home which can produce results in one-20 minutes.
  ,
  ,
  A , report recently said the world was opening up to home testing for HIV since fewer than half of those living with HIV knew their status. This is a huge barrier to treatment scale up.
  ,
  ,
  ""Despite the advances in technology, testing is still approached with fear, accessing clinics is inconvenient and the experience of HIV testing is often stigmatizing. The cost of these tests is now measured in cents,"" UNAIDS said.

"Updated: Jul 10, 2012, 02:22 IST",HIV scare in Mumbai as funds dry up,"

  MUMBAI: An , scare looms large over Mumbai as regular supply of condoms, syringes and medicines to tackle the deadly virus has nearly dried up in its most vulnerable pockets. Twenty-one NGOs (non-governmental organizations) and 13 community-based organizations (CBOs) that handle a total of 52 intervention projects for the city's population at highest risk of contacting and spreading HIV have not received central government funds since April.
  
  ,
  This blow comes at a time when already close to 60,000 of the 4.20 lakh individuals in the state afflicted with HIV are living in the city. Although its prevalence in the general population has been on a decline, the graph has only been rising for the high-risk groups.
  ,
  ,
  The crunch in funds has directly affected efforts made by agencies to protect an estimated 2.34 lakh high-risk individuals. They include , (FSW), transgender individuals, men having sex with men (MSM), intravenous drug users (IDU), truckers and migrants. Currently, HIV prevalence among FSW is as high as 27%, 18% in IDUs, 12% in MSM and 30% in the transgender population.
  ,
  ,
  ,
  Following the fund crisis, most NGOs and CBOs have been forced to downsize their workforce and a few have even completely stalled their work. Funds allocated to each project vary from Rs 9 lakh to 20 lakh, depending on its reach. Without the money, most organizations have been unable to pay their staffers, and have defaulted on the rents and electricity bills. The worst hit are some former sex workers-turned-outreach workers and -peer educators, who have had to go back to their old ways to support their families.
  ,
  ,
  TOI came across one such outreach worker from Malwani who said she waited for two months for her salary of Rs 7,000 to arrive. ""On the third month, I had no choice but to do the only work I knew,"" said the worker, who is associated with a CBO that caters to the transgender population. As an outreach worker, her job is to visit brothels to distribute condoms and inform new entrants about prevention.
  ,
  ,
  A Ghatkopar-based NGO told TOI that they were struggling to even purchase stationery for daily use while a south Mumbai CBO that works with MSM said they had to take huge loans to meet ends. Eldred Tellis, director of ,, said he had to borrow approximately Rs 7.5 lakh from his trust's buffer to sustain three IDU projects. ""Though bigger NGOs can sustain for a while, smaller organizations are finding it extremely difficult to cope,"" he said.
  ,
  ,
  Ashok Row Kavi, founder-chairperson of Humsafar Trust, also said three of his MSM projects were badly hit. ""Without paying salaries, how can I expect my volunteers to be present at the site and distribute condoms everyday? This (fund crunch) has created a dent in the measures taken so far and an increase in HIV prevalence is likely,"" he said.
  ,
  ,
  Dr Balkrishna Adsul, additional project director of Mumbai District Aids Control Society (,), said, ""The delay was from NACO's end. But funds have arrived now and we have started disbursing it already."" He also said the crunch at the Centre could be caused by the drying up of money from global agencies. Geneva-based Global Fund (GF) had announced stoppage of funds till 2014 for diseases, including HIV, in India.
  ,
  ,
  Dr Neeraj Dhingra, deputy director general, NACO, said he would check how and why the crunch happened. ""There is sufficient money to fund projects as long as NGOs are clear with their records,"" he said.

The drug,'Truvada' can now be used by those at high risk of the infection and anyone who may engage in sexual activity with HIV-infected partners, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced.

  There are concerns that circulation of such a drug could engender a false sense of security and mean people will take more risks. There have also been fears that a drug-resistant strain of HIV could develop. People diagnosed with HIV that without treatment develops into AIDS take antiviral medications to control the infection that attacks their immune system.

  Earlier this week, the Food and , Administration approved a daily pill, Truvada, which reduces the risk of HIV infection.
  ,
  A team of researchers from the , Medical Center is progressing towards developing weekly or twice-monthly injectable antiretroviral therapy (ART) nanomedicines for patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.
  ,
  A long-acting, nanoformulated ART (nanoART) would be a substantive improvement over daily and sometimes more complex regimen of ,, lead investigator on the development of nanoART for , and professor and chairman of the department of pharmacology and experimental neuroscience (PEN) at UNMC, Howard Gendelman, MD, said.
  ,
  A journal article hails the successful testing of UNMC's ART injectables as treatment of HIV-infected mice and in preventing new infections.
  ,
  ""We actually followed the process exactly as we would with a person - and it worked,"" Dr. Gendelman said.
  ,
  ""This is all very exciting. Although there are clear pitfalls ahead and the medicines are not yet ready for human use, the progress is undeniable.""
  ,
  Dr. Gendelman said one of the project's real advantages is in the nanoformulations.
  ,
  ""NanoART is cell directed. So when you take a pill, the pill travels throughout the body indiscriminately. In these nanomedicines, you can use the body's own cells to direct the medicine where you want it to go,"" he said.
  ,
  The UNMC project directs the medicine to the monocyte-macrophage, cells which carry the drug particle to sites of the body specifically where HIV grows.
  ,
  ""You're using the cell that is the target for the virus to deliver the drug against the virus,"" Dr. Gendelman said.
  ,
  Dr. Gendelman calls the progress made ""a Nebraska invention,"" as it involved so many of the state's scientists in different disciplines working together.
  ,
  He said this marks the third article his team has had published in major biomedical journals in recent months with all the articles related to the nanomedicine injectable therapy.
  ,
  The advance to use the new nanomedicines to specifically target reservoirs for viral infection was explained by ,, Ph.D., associate professor in PEN, lead investigator, and published in the International Journal of Nanomedicine. This paper describes how these drug inventions can enter the brain and ameliorate nervous system disease.
  ,
  The third study, published in Trends in Neurosciences, is a research area led by Larisa Poluektova, M.D., Ph.D., associate professor in PEN, and the developer of the mouse models of HIV/AIDS used in study.
  ,
  ""We work as a team and work effectively as a team with different scientists with very different disciplines involved in different aspects of the work,"" Dr. Gendelman said.
  ,
  This research team is made up of two UNMC colleges, four departments and two universities. The drugs were developed in UNMC labs using nanoformulation approaches.
  ,
  The ART tests in mouse models were made possible by UNMC's development of specially designed mice. Because mice cannot catch human HIV, UNMC has developed mice with the equivalent of a human immune system. Such a mouse model enables advanced tests on HIV and its treatment.
  ,
  Dr. Kanmogne said an ART injection would be an improvement for HIV patients because it would produce all the medicine needed without the complications of remembering to take pills daily, drug toxicities, buildup of viral resistance, intestinal problems, or the social stigma of pills.

  NEW DELHI: Hepatitis, which causes inflammation of liver, kills more people in India than HIV/AIDS, , and , combined, WHO representative to India Nata Menabde said on Saturday, which was World , Day. She said mass awareness, universal guidelines for immunization and hygienic handling of food and water can reduce the liver disease burden substantially.
  
  ,
  Menabde was speaking at the inauguration of the 'Health Liver' campaign by Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences (ILBS), India's first NABH accredited super specialty institute. Delhi health minister AK Walia and K Srinath Reddy, director of the Public Health Foundation of India (PHFI), among others, were present on the occasion.
  ,
  ,
  Menabde said there are five main hepatitis viruses, types A, B, C, D and E, of which B and C are most lethal as they can lead to liver cirrhosis and cancer. She added, ""About six lakh people die every year due to the acute or chronic consequences of hepatitis B, nearly 100 times more than HIV/AIDS.""
  ,
  ,
  Walia said that both hepatitis B and C spread through contact with the blood of an infected person. It can be through transfusion of infected blood, sharing of contaminated needles or injection material. Hepatitis B can also be transmitted from mother to child. ""To check the spread of the disease through blood transfusion, we are going to introduce Nucleic Acid Test (,) to ensure immediate and accurate screening of infectious diseases such as hepatitis and , in donated blood,"" Walia said. He added that Delhi is among the first few states to have introduced vaccination for hepatitis B in the universal immunization programme. Hepatitis A and E, the commonest forms of viral hepatitis, spread mainly through contaminated food or water. The state health minister said that they are taking all measures to ensure clean drinking water facility to all citizens.
  ,

  The Delhi government is also planning to provide increased financial assistance to poor patients undergoing liver transplant, kidney transplant and other super-specialty procedures — Rs 3 lakh for those undergoing treatment at private hospitals and Rs 5 lakh for those being treated by government hospitals.
  ,
  ,
  According to Dr Shiv Sarin, director, ILBS, hepatitis rarely presents symptoms until very late. ""For example, a person infected with hepatitis C virus may carry the virus for as long as 10 years or even 20 years without presenting any obvious symptom. Regular health check-up is advised for people above 40 years of age,"" he said.

  CHENNAI: Tamil Nadu, which even 10 years ago had an alarmingly high incidence of , infection, has dropped from third to fifth among states with the largest number of people infected with the deadly virus.
  
  ,
  Tamil Nadu previously ranked in the top three with 1.54 lakh HIV-positive people, it has now been overtaken by Karnataka (2.45 lakh), and West Bengal (1.67 lakh). Andhra Pradesh, which accounts for 5 lakh of the 24 lakh HIV positive in the country, remains the state with the most number of HIV-infected people, official statistics show.
  ,
  ,
  Government and private initiatives have helped reduce the number of people infected each year in the state, said officials of Tamil Nadu State AIDS Control Society (TNSACS). ""Around 27,000 people tested positive for HIV in the state in 2009,"" said a TNSACS official. ""In 2010, the number dropped to 23,000, and in 2011, it fell further to 20,000. That's a decrease of 7,000 new cases in two years.""
  ,
  ,
  Activists attribute the success of the state's AIDS programme to the commitment of the health sector and the government. ""Tamil Nadu was the first state to start an autonomous AIDS control society and the model, backed by political will, has been very successful,"" said Dr R Lakshmibai of Tamil Nadu Aids Initiative. ""National AIDS Control Organisation has recommended the model to other states.""
  ,
  ,
  The state has benefitted from specialized target intervention programmes that go beyond focusing on vulnerable groups such as sex workers, said M Ramar of Centre for Social Development and Social Work Research in Coimbatore who runs intervention programs for migrant workers.
  ,
  ,
  ""Once we started targeting their clients, which spans various groups like migrant workers, truckers and youngsters, things started looking better,"" Ramar said. ""I see a sense of awareness among migrant workers here. Fewer migrant workers than before are testing positive each year. Red ribbon clubs are also doing good work at college level.""
  ,
  ,
  According to Dr Lakshmibai, intervention programmes prevented the disease from reaching generalised epidemic proportions. ""There are three levels — nascent epidemic, concentrated epidemic and generalised epidemic,"" she said. ""The state never let it reach the generalised stage. When it looked like our intervention programs were only creating awareness and not changing behaviour, the state brought in specialised programmes.""
  ,
  ,
  Andhra Pradesh, on the other hand, shut down 266 of its first-level detection and counselling centres due to a cash crunch. However, Dr Lakshmibai added that although Tamil Nadu is doing well, sustaining the effort to reduce the incidence of new cases will be a challenge. ""Trends and sexual behaviour keeps changing,"" she said. ""Agencies have to keep track of all developments while designing preventive programmes.""
  ,
  ,
  The state also has its work cut out in its intervention programme for transgenders. ""The first survey was done only recently and shows that 9% of transgenders in the state are HIV-positive, a higher ratio than the 6% of female sex workers,"" Dr Lakshmibai said.

  According to officials of the , (KSACS), which conducts targeted intervention projects for high-risk groups, migrant labourers and more specifically men having sex with men (MSMs) among them is a category that has been completely neglected in the state. ""They are a category that remains totally unchecked. We are yet to launch projects specifically targeting MSMs among the migrant labour community.
  ,
  ,
  They pose a serious risk of spreading HIV infection in the society as they have started to mingle with local people for money and sexual gratification,"" said KSACS (targeted intervention) joint director Dennis Joseph.
  ,
  ,
  Kochi has nearly 1,200 MSMs who are registered and covered under various projects of the KSACS.

  ""We have programmes focusing on MSMs from the lower strata who need to be made aware of safe practices. But they don't include migrant labourers. Moreover, a large number of MSMs belong to the economically upward bracket and operate in a different platform compared to the lower strata,"" he said.

"Updated: Aug 26, 2012, 05:53 IST",Hunt for HIV Slayers,"

  ,
  
  ,
  NEW DELHI: Almost 25 years after she identified India's first six cases of HIV way back in 1986, Dr , is on another pathbreaking hunt - to find a 'broadly neutralizing antibody' (bNab) from the blood of an Indian HIV patient.
  ,
  ,
  There's a global hunt on for bNabs, a set of antibodies that can be found in the blood of HIV patients. These antibodies are capable of stopping the HIV virus from entering blood cells and replicating , thereby arresting an HIV-infected person's progression to AIDS. (An antibody is an infection-fighting protein produced by our immune system when it detects harmful substances like viruses and bacteria.)
  ,
  ,
  Called Protocol G, the global project to identify bNabs was started in 2006 by the International Aids Vaccine Initiative (IAVI). So far, blood samples of 1,800 such HIV patients have been screened across 12 countries and 19 bNAbs identified. ,, IAVI president told TOI that these special antibodies hold vital clues to the design of an effective AIDS vaccine that has eluded scientists so far.
  ,
  ,
  The Chennai-based Solomon is busy identifying a rare tribe of HIV-infected patients from across India who've been healthy for years without requiring life-saving anti-retroviral treatment (ART). These people are called ""elite controllers"" . ""The goal is to isolate antibodies that are broadly effective against Clade C subtype of HIV, which predominates in India,"" McGlynn added.
  ,
  ,
  The blood samples collected are sent to the all-new Translational Health Sciences and Technology Institute (THSTI) in Gurgaon where scientists will isolate antibodies for testing and see if any of them can stop a variety of HIV subtypes from infecting their target cells.
  ,
  ,
  Solomon, who works at YR Gaitonde Center for AIDS Research and Education (YRG CARE) said, ""Only a minority of people who are infected with HIV produce bNAbs. Although HIV is a wildly mutable virus, certain parts of it are relatively resistant to change. These are essential to the virus's ability to infect, and they are the elements of HIV that bNAbs target.""
  ,
  ,
  Till now, blood samples from 39 elite controllers have been collected. ""We look for patients who've been infected for over four years but have not required ART. We estimate that of 100 such people, 20% would contain a bNab. We are collecting their blood samples and isolating cells that produce the bNab.""
  ,
  ,
  Solomon's team aims to collect samples from 200 elite controllers. ""If IAVI manages to isolate a bNab from any of these blood samples, we will call the patient back and collect 200 ml of blood from him or her over a period of six months. We will then prepare more bNabs from it and try to develop a vaccine,"" she says.
  ,
  ,
  IAVI India chief , says these antibodies could ultimately reveal the Achilles' heel of the virus and help create the HIV vaccine . Experts at the THSTI will look at how the bNab binds to the virus. This will tell scientists which part of the virus the vaccine should target. ""The idea is to create artificially synthesized mimics of their targets on HIV, to be used in vaccines to elicit similar actions and teach the immune system how to thwart HIV infection,"" experts said.
  ,
  ,
  ""With 7,100 people contracting HIV every day, effective tools to prevent infection are indispensable in the fight against HIV. A broadlyeffective AIDS vaccine would be a powerful asset,"" said M K Bhan, secretary of the department of biotechnology.
  ,
  ,
  No bNabs have yet been isolated in the India programme . But it's early days yet, said McGlynn. ""Serum samples collected will first be analyzed for their breadth of neutralization of HIV - in other words, the variety of HIV strains they can neutralize in laboratory assays. The most broadly neutralizing sera will be further analyzed to isolate and clone the antibodies responsible for that activity.""
  ,
  ,
  Those antibodies will then be studied in detail for their biochemistry and, if possible, molecular structures and the structures that each targets on the HIV virus . The package of information gleaned will then be put to use to design a new class of the Aids vaccine.

  Only a few HIVinfected produce bNAbs
  ,
  ,
  Why bNabs are important

It is admitted that the petitioner is an AIDS patient and the medical board found that he could discharge light duties."" , The driver joined the Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation's Salem division as a daily wager in May 1998 and in September 1999 his services were regularised. After an unblemished service for more than 11 years, he started falling ill frequently. In January 2010 he tested positive for HIV and began treatment at the Government Mohan Kumaramangalam Medical College Hospital in Salem. , He was unable to discharge his regular duties due to his illness and was forced to take all the available leave. The management initiated punitive action against him for unauthorised absence from March 12, 2011. His representation to the authorities that his continued absence was due to his medical condition and action against him be dropped fell on deaf ears, as he was directed to appear before the corporation medical officer for examination. , On October 15, 2011, the medical officer of the corporation examined him and found him 'not fit' for the driver's job. , He immediately approached the Madras high court invoking Section 47 of the Persons With Disabilities (Equal Opportunities, Protection of Rights and Full Participation) Act, 1995, seeking alternative employment with pay protection. After this petition was filed, he was referred to a medical board at the Government Mohan Kumaramangalam Medical College Hospital in Salem. On April 9, 2012, the board found that he could not do heavy work, but could be used for light work. When the matter was taken up for hearing, the management informed the court that appropriate orders would be passed soon on the basis of the medical board's report. , Justice Hariparanthaman, however, cited the mandatory duty of the management under the PWD Act and said the driver should be provided with alternative employment within two weeks, and his pay too should be protected by the authorities.

"Roshni Olivera and Ismat Tahseen,Oct 25, 2012, 00:00 IST,Should an HIV test before marriage be made compulsory? (Thinkstock photos/Getty Images)",Should an HIV test before marriage be made compulsory?,"

  ,
  
  ,
  Madhu's (name changed) life has just come crashing down. The 23-year-old, married for the past one-and-a-half years, has tested positive for HIV and she knows she has contracted it from her husband. Her family is distraught but there's little they can do. ""Now, we realise the importance of getting an HIV test done before marriage,"" says her father. Madhu's is not the only case. Many such instances across the country are highlighting an urgent need to make HIV test mandatory before marriage. The State , and Child Development department is actively considering the move. In fact, Varsha Gaikwad, Minister, Women and Child Development, recently said that her department had sought opinions in this regard from , and NGOs working for the welfare of HIV patients. But to bring about this rule, amendments to provisions of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 and other allied Acts, will be needed. And even though it looks like the need of the hour, it's not that simple. In the past, such a move has encountered a number of hindrances.
  ,
  ,
  ,
  :
  ,
  ,
  Some argue that making this test mandatory infringes upon a person's right to privacy, which is a fundamental human right. Also, a big concern is that post-tests, an infected person may be ostracised in his/her community.
  ,
  ,
  A generalised policy like this could adversely affect HIV control programme itself, as fear of social discrimination could force people to flee rather than come forward to declare their HIV status.
  ,
  ,
  That apart, there are people opposing it because of the veracity of HIV tests. A wrong diagnosis could cause havoc in a person's life. Besides, there is something called a window period during which a person may test negative despite being infected. Says gynaecologist Dr Firuza Parekh, ""The HIV test is not fool-proof. At the time of testing, a person may come negative but turn positive six months later due to the window period. That apart, there's also the question of who will bear the cost of the test. So, what are we trying to prove through these tests? Is it just promiscuity because in that case, a person could even cheat by getting somebody else's test result.""
  ,
  ,
  Sexologist and marriage counsellor Dr Shirish Malde, agrees. ""People might resort to getting fake test reports. Also, asking for this test can give rise to certain trust issues,"" he says. But the fact is that there are many cases where a person has contracted the virus from his/her partner and often it comes to fore when the woman is pregnant, he says. ""And the person who was already infected at the time of marriage tends to pretend or actually may not even have been aware. So making such a test mandatory before marriage may help,""
  ,
  ,
  ,
  :
  ,
  ,
  In Mumbai, a large section of people, especially youngsters, are of the opinion that the test must be made mandatory. ""People are worried to ask a potential groom in particular for a test, lest it upsets him and his family. But, it's as important as checking the kundlis in current times,"" says 26-year-old Tina Raina, a computer professional. A thought echoed by may others. Dr I S Gilada, President of AIDS Society of India, who has been working in this field for almost three decades, emphasises, ""This step may upset some people in our traditional society who might even call of a marriage. It's mainly young unsuspecting women who suffer in this. Human rights activists may say that declaring HIV status of one person to the other is violation of his/ her privacy. But doesn't the potential spouse have a right to be protected from the disease? One's right to privacy cannot infringe upon another's right to life. In fact if it is made mandatory, there will be more awareness and more people going in for regular checkups.""
  ,
  ,
  ,
  ,
  ,
  Instead of just an HIV test, a couple about to get married could undergo a comprehensive health check-up that includes tests for ,, thalassemia, haemophilia and other sexually transmitted diseases. ""This way we can ensure better medical compatibility between partners. And even if a partner tests positive for HIV, he/she can be rejected only as 'medically unfit' and won't have to carry the stigma of an , patient. Vice-verse, if they decide to go ahead with the marriage, it is with fullest knowledge and understanding, so they can't blame anyone,"" says Gilada. States like Kerala, , and Goa in the past attempted to bring about such a rule, but could not succeed. Will Maharashtra manage to do it? Let's see...
  ,
  ,
  ,
  :
  ,
  ,
  If such a bill is being considered, I'm glad it is because we definitely need this, especially in areas where education levels are low. Many suffer because of not having knowledge and rather than that suffering, it's better you are aware of things beforehand.
  ,
  ,
  ,
  ,
  ,
  There's no clear-cut answer. In principle it seems logical enough: both partners should make an informed decision. But by legalising the process, not only do you bring the state into the bedroom, you also stigmatise HIV further. After all, there are many conditions that must be ascertained before we enter a partnership. Why aren't those investigated?
  ,
  ,
  ,
  ,
  ,
  Making the test mandatory could intensify the inhuman stigmatisation that HIV-positive individuals and AIDS patients grapple with. Brides and grooms must be encouraged to take the test before marriage, but it should be voluntary.
  ,
  ,
  ,
  ,
  ,
  I totally agree with the government and feel everybody must go for a check-up every six months. Nowadays, people are indulging in all kinds of vices. Today, a wife doesn't know if her husband has been in a relationship with another man or woman!
  ,
  ,
  ,
  :
  ,
  ,
  In our country, where there is still a very prevalent arranged marriage system, a mandatory HIV test would be a boon. Due to our conservative society, these questions are barely asked.
  ,
  ,
  ,
  :
  ,
  ,
  Alarming statistics show how children suffer because of their parents being HIV positive and women who not find out if their husbands are HIV positive suffer. It's thus best to be aware.
  ,
  ,
  ,
  ,
  ,
  Everyone should get an AIDS test; the government should organise this free of cost and have an awareness campaign on sex education. What is more of a concern, is how we treat those who are AIDS victims.
  ,
  ,
  ,
  ,
  ,
  I totally support this move to have an HIV test before marriage; especially when one is beginning a family. It will also be a step towards removing the , attached with AIDS.
  ,
  ,
  ,
  ,
  ,
  I agree with the move. Some families may not like it because they are traditional. I feel the issue is personal.

  ,
  Pradipkumar, who arrived at Imphal airport in the afternoon, was greeted by functionaries of All Manipur Gymnasium Welfare Association, his family members, well-wishers and members of Self Support Group (SSG), a body formed by HIV positive widows of the state.

  ""I'm feeling very happy after bagging the prestigious ""Mr South Asia"" title. I have proved that people living with HIV can do wonders. I'm facing a tough time ahead of the 4{+t}{+h} Mr World championship scheduled to be held in Bangkok next month as I lack funds to procure nutritional diet. But I'll go on for the title,"" said Pradip (43). The muscleman spends about Rs 40,000 in procuring nutritional diet every month.
  ,
  ,
  Pradip, who is on Anti Retroviral Therapy (ART), faced great hardships in arranging money to buy nutritional diet few ahead of his ""Mr South Asia"" competition. Manipur Aids Control Society (MACS), which used to pay Rs 8000 a month to Pradipkumar for procuring his nutritional support after appointing him as its brand ambassador, has stopped paying the money to him since June.
  ,
  ,
  Another setback was the government's failure to appoint him as a regular employee in the youth affairs and sports department despite tall promises made by a minister in 2009. All was not lost for him as members of SSG carried out a charity campaign and gave Rs 90,000 to him.

  ,
  Maya is among the 34 residents of a children's home in Bandikavanur village, about 30km from Chennai, who stepped into a school for the first time on Wednesday after HIV played havoc in their lives. They are all children of HIV+ve people.
  ,
  ,
  While most of them have lost either or both of their parents, 19 of them inherited the virus. The children — 18 girls and 16 boys — were admitted to a primary school in the village in Thiruvallur district under the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan's 'Education for all' scheme.
  ,
  ,
  For most of these children, the scheme gave them their first shot at leading a ""normal"" life. ""I've often stood by the gate of the children's home and watched school kids in uniforms jostle with one another.

  ,
  ,
  The 34 children, from across the state, are currently under the care of the Community Health Education Society (CHES), which has a home in the village that houses 85 HIV infected and affected children. Most of them find schooling difficult because of opposition from the school authorities and other parents who know about their health status.
  ,
  ,
   , school principal N Shanthi said it wasn't easy admitting these children. ""In the beginning, we had decided not to reveal the children's background, but word soon got around and we had parents approaching us asking if their wards would get infected. Explaining the situation wasn't easy, but the panchayat head and elders in the village got together and explained things to them,"" she said. The school also made provisions to cater to the medical needs of the children and the teachers are being trained to handle emergencies.
  ,
  ,
  For CHES, it marks the end of a 19-year struggle. ""For close to two decades, we have been trying to send HIV-affected children to mainstream schools, but few would admit them.

"Updated: Nov 21, 2012, 02:57 IST",India records 25% dip in new HIV infections,"

  NEW DELHI: First the good news: globally there were more than half a million fewer AIDS-related deaths in 2011 than in 2005, with India reporting a 25% dip in the rate of new , between 2001 and 2011.
  
  ,
  But even then last year alone, 1.7 million people died from AIDS-related causes worldwide. Globally, 2.5 million people became newly infected with HIV in 2011.
  ,
  ,
  Half of all reductions in new HIV infections in the last two years have been among newborn children showing that elimination of new infections in children is possible.
  ,
  ,
  In 2011, there were 34 million people living with HIV. In South and south-east Asia, an estimated 4 million people were living with HIV in 2011, compared to 3.7 million in 2001.
  ,
  ,
  The same year, new infections in children were 43% lower than in 2003, and 24% lower than 2009. However, 72% of children living with HIV do not have any access to treatment.
  ,
  ,
  An estimated 6.8 million people are eligible for treatment, but don't have access.
  ,
  ,
  These are the findings of the Global , Epidemic 2012 report released by UNAIDS on Tuesday. The number of people accessing HIV treatment has increased by 63% between 2009 and 2011.
  ,
  ,
  In India, however, around 60% people requiring treatment are getting it. ""The pace of progress is quickening — what used to take a decade is now being achieved in 24 months,"" said Michel Sidibe, executive director of UNAIDS. ""We are scaling up faster and smarter than ever before. It is the proof that with political will and follow through we can reach our shared goals by 2015,"" he said.
  ,
  ,
  Gains have been made in reducing tuberculosis (TB)-related AIDS deaths in people living with HIV. In the last 24 months, a 13% decrease in TB-related AIDS deaths was observed. This accomplishment is due to record number of people with HIV/TB co-infection accessing antiretroviral treatment, which is recorded at 45%.
  ,
  ,
  UNAIDS also estimates that an additional 4 million discordant couples (where one partner is living with HIV) would benefit from HIV treatment to protect their partners from HIV infection.
  ,
  ,
  Of the 34 million people living with HIV, about half do not know their HIV status. The report states that if more people knew their status, they could come forward for HIV services.
  ,
  ,
  For example, South Africa increased its scale up of HIV treatment by 75% in the last two years—ensuring 1.7 million people had access to the lifesaving treatment—and new HIV infections have fallen by more than 50,000 in only two years.
  ,
  ,
  The report shows that a more than 50% reduction in the rate of new HIV infections has been achieved across 25 low and middle-income countries -- more than half in Africa, the region most affected by HIV.
  ,
  ,
  In some of the countries which have the highest HIV prevalence in the world, rates of new HIV infections have been cut dramatically since 2001 — by 73% in Malawi, Botswana (71%), Namibia (68%), Zambia (58%), Zimbabwe (50%), South Africa and Swaziland (41%).
  ,
  ,
  In addition to welcome results in HIV prevention, sub-Saharan Africa has reduced AIDS-related deaths by one-third in the last six years and increased the number of people on antiretroviral treatment by 59% in the last two years alone.
  ,
  ,
  The area where perhaps most progress is being made is in reducing new HIV infections in children. Half of the global reductions in new HIV infections in the last two years have been among newborn children. ""It is becoming evident that achieving zero new HIV infections in children is possible,"" said Sidibe. ""I am excited that far fewer babies are being born with HIV. We are moving from despair to hope,"" he added.
  ,
  ,
  The report shows that antiretroviral therapy has emerged as a powerful force for saving lives. In the last 24 months the numbers of people accessing treatment has increased by 63% globally. In sub-Saharan Africa, a record 2.3 million people had access to treatment. China has increased the number of people on HIV treatment by nearly 50% in the last year alone. There were more than half a million fewer deaths in 2011 than in 2005. The largest drops in AIDS-related deaths are being seen in countries where HIV has the strongest grip. South Africa saw (100,000) fewer deaths, Zimbabwe (nearly 90,000), Kenya (71,000) and Ethiopia (48,000) than in 2005.

  ""In 2012, governments increasingly recognize that these restrictions make no sense in a world in which HIV exists in every country, people living with HIV are living long and productive lives and equal freedom of movement is not only a human right but essential in a globalized world. Of note is the decline in the number of countries, territories and areas with HIV-related travel restrictions from 96 in 2000 to 45 in 2012,"" UNAIDS said.

  ,
  UNAIDS aims to eliminate these restrictions by 2015.

  Since 2010, Armenia, China, Fiji, Namibia, the Republic of Korea, the Republic of Moldova, Ukraine and the US have repealed such restrictions. Where such restrictions continue to exist, other forms of HIV stigma and discrimination are usually common.
  ,
  ,
  The World Health Organization (WHO) pointed out that such entry restrictions mount pressure on people into concealing their HIV infection from immigration authorities.
  ,
  ,
  ""They simply do not carry their HIV medicines on international trips. This could lead to drug-resistant HIV strains that are transmissible to other people. Besides, drug resistance allows HIV to replicate in the body more freely, people with higher viral loads are also more infectious,"" WHO said.

  NEW DELHI: Some of the world's most powerful CEOs have now joined hands to bring down repressive laws by around 45 countries that still deport, detain or deny entry to people solely because they are living with HIV.
  
  ,
  Days after TOI reported how 45 countries — many of them major hubs for international business -- still ban travel of HIV infected patients, more than 40 CEOs who represent nearly 2 million employees from companies like Johnson & Johnson, Coca-Cola, Pfizer, Heineken, Merck, the National Basketball Association and Thomson Reuters signed an unprecedented pledge urging the repeal of laws and policies in these countries that restrict movement of , patients.
  ,
  ,
  The CEOs said they opposed HIV travel restrictions because they were discriminatory and because to succeed in today's globalized economy, companies must be able to send their employees and best talent overseas, regardless of their HIV status.
  ,
  ,
  ""It's time to send HIV travel restrictions packing,"" said Kenneth Cole, CEO of Kenneth Cole Productions. ""Using our collective might, I believe we can use our influence to eliminate these discriminatory practices.""

  Most HIV-travel restrictions were imposed by governments in the 1980s when little was known about the transmission of HIV, and treatment didn't exist. ""Since then, we've learned how to effectively prevent, manage and treat HIV,"" , said.

  ,
  ,
  ""At present around 10 HIV patients are being treated in the ART centre, BHU. They are not backpackers or foreigners but natives of the city, who are youngsters and middle-aged people. Such drug abusers are often seen at ghats and older parts of the city. Mass sharing of the syringe and needle is often a common practice by drug abusers that invites HIV infection. The trend is catching fast which is very unlikely for a city like Varanasi,"" Sunder added.
  ,
  ,
  The officials of NACO, Varanasi, stated that the entire eastern UP area is turning out to be a highly sensitive zone for HIV infections because of migration from rural to urban slum areas and even metropolitan cities. Jaunpur, Azamgarh and Ghazipur are identified as the highly sensitive districts. Varanasi ranks at number four. Most of these patients are in the age group of 20 to 45 years and bread winners for the families. Almost 90 per cent of the patients belong to lower middle class families and have poor economic conditions.

"Dec 1, 2012, 06:50 IST",HIV positive women join forces to sew up self-reliant lives,"

  CHANDIGARH: , would have remained a distant notion for 34-year-old Sangeeta, had the man she married told her he was ,. As things turned out, she got married and got infected. The husband is no more but there's her, two children and the virus.
  
  ,
  In a country where people living with AIDS are still subjected to ostracism, a lone HIV positive woman with two children did not really stand a chance. But there is something to be said about sheer grit. If you have it, even gunny bags can give you a lease of life. In Sangeeta's case, the gunny bags came with something even more precious - dignity. The feisty lady has received a bulk contract from a Kalka-based company to sew gunny bags for Rs 4,000 month. On World Aids Day, nine women living with AIDS joined her to make a living sewing gunny bags. She calls women living with AIDS on her mobile phone. One, she proudly points out, she bought herself.
  ,
  ,
  At 31, Saumya is treading the same path. Like Sangeeta, Saumya lost her husband, who was HIV positive. Unlike Sangeeta, the legacy she received included not only HIV but also TB. It was not possible for her to work anywhere till people from the drop-in-centre approached her to help her earn by stitching gunny bags. She is also trying to reach out to women deprived of care when they need it the most. ""I have seen the vicissitudes of life and I am trying to guide women suffering the same way,"" she said.
  ,
  ,
  It was Archana, in-charge of the drop-in-centre who conceived the idea of helping women with the craft of making polybags. Archana, who lives with AIDS herself, plans to expand operations to include more women in the ambit of the self-sustaining group.
  ,
  ,
  ""We went to Anandpur Sahib a few days ago where we saw women working on recycled paper for a well known company. Though the marketing was not impressive, it generated Rs 1,500 per month. We decided to modify the concept and raise income for the women,"" she said.
  ,
  ,
  While the centre has a special machine to imprint the names that buyers want, they also plan to buy a machine which can be used to make disposable cups and glasses. ""With these self employment schemes, we will expand services to all 100 women living with HIV in the city,"" said Archana.

  JAIPUR: The , (RSACS) is expanding its HIV testing facility up to the block level since the entire state is vulnerable to HIV/AIDS.
  ,
  ,
  Earlier, the HIV testing facilities were available at all government medical colleges, district hospitals and community heath centres of seven high risk districts. Now, RSACS has decided not to keep confine the HIV testing facilities at high risk districts but also to expand it to other districts as well.
  ,
  ,
  ""Rajasthan has a special situation in terms of equal HIV prevalence rates of both urban and rural areas,"" an RSACS official said.
  ,
  ,
  The official said already 182 Integrated Counseling and Testing Centres (ICTC) are in the state. However, majority of the ICTCs were located at seven districts - Jaipur, Ajmer, Alwar, Tonk, Udaipur, Barmar and Sriganganagar. Except in these seven districts, the other districts lack testing centres. The HIV testing in private hospitals is costly but at the government's centres, it is free of cost, the official said, adding that expanding the testing facility would strengthen healthcare facilities in the state.
  ,
  ,
  Apart from 182, another 282 more testing centres would be opened in the state with help from the staff of the community health centres (CHC). The RSACS would provide HIV testing kits to the CHCs. Trained counselors would be posted at the CHCs and would counsel people coming to the centre for HIV testing. For the purpose, the RSACS would provide training to , (NRHM) employees deployed at the CHCs.
  ,
  ,
  The RSACS data show that till January of the financial year 2010-11, altogether 1.92 lakh general clients were counseled, 1.87 lakh tested and 6,417 persons tested positive for the HIV.
  ,
  ,
  The new ICTC would impart information people about HIV prevention, counsels them to undergo testing, provides testing facilities and also links positive people with treatment, care and support system, the RSACS said.

"Updated: Dec 1, 2012, 04:52 IST",AP piloting new drug regime to check HIV infection in new-borns,"

  VISAKHAPATNAM: The AP AID's Control Programme is now focussing on prevention of vertical transmission of HIV infection from pregnant women to newborns by introducing a triple-drug regimen as against the single drug treatment with Nevirapine. The prevalence of HIV among pregnant women in the seven coastal districts combined is 0.81 per cent, which is more than the state average of 0.77 per cent.
  
  ,
  As per , (APSACS) data, the highest prevalence of HIV among pregnant women is in Kadapa (2.25 %), followed by the coastal district of East Godavari (1.25 per cent). In Krishna (1 %), Guntur (1.08 %) and West Godavari it is close to the state average. Vizag, Vizianagaram and Srikakulam are however a little lower than the state average.
  ,
  ,
   , of APSACS C Partha Sarathi said, ""We have given special focus on prevention of new infections from pregnant women to newborns during pregnancy, delivery and breastfeeding. The vertical (mother to child) transmission rate without any medication is around 30 per cent. During the last National Aids Control Programme (NACP), we were able to bring down this transmission rate to about 10 per cent with single dose Nevirapine prophylaxis in the mother-baby pairs. But AP is now piloting the superior triple drug regime, which aims at bringing down the HIV infection in newborns to around three per cent.""
  ,
  ,
  Recently, , and Karnataka launched the PPTCT (prevention of parent to child transmission) 'triple drug regimen'. ""There will be a paradigm shift with the triple-drug regimen. The state is now looking forward to bringing down the mother-to-child transmission to zero,"" said state epidemiologist K Jaya Krishna and deputy director (monitoring, evaluation and surveillance), APSACS.
  ,
  ,
  Ronanki Ramesh, additional district medical and health officer (AIDS and leprosy), Visakhapatnam, said, ""Around 85 per cent of HIV transmission happens due to unsafe sex, while around 15 per cent is passed on from the pregnant mother to the child. It's now possible to stop vertical transmission by 98 per cent with the use of a combination of three ARV drugs starting from 14 weeks of pregnancy irrespective of CD4 count till the end of breastfeeding that is up to one or one and a half years. Soon after delivery, the infant will be given Nevarapine syrup for six weeks to be followed up for DBS-PCR tests till 18 months. The triple drug regimen under Mamta Plus programme also spikes the risk of drug resistance,"" he stated.
  ,
  ,
  AP is planning to give special importance to counselling and testing programme in the coming year and has set a target for 35 lakh tests (including 15 lakhs pregnant women).
  ,
  ,
  Overall, according to APSACS, new infections are on the decline in the state with an approximately 23 per cent decline in new infections being recorded in 2009 in comparison to 2006. ANC prevalence dropped down to less than 1% (0.77%) for the first time in 2010, as per the latest survey.

"Updated: Dec 1, 2012, 05:48 IST",HIV grooms tying knots of sorrow,"

  VISAKHAPATNAM: Twenty-year-old Sujata's (name changed) dreams and joy of becoming mother of a healthy child were shattered when she underwent blood tests during pregnancy. The mom-to-be, who hails from the Old Town area, discovered to her horror that she had tested positive for ,.
  
  ,
  What unfolded thereafter was nothing short of a tragedy. The child she gave birth to was born HIV positive and died within weeks of birth. Her husband Raju (name changed), whom she married in 2008 and was one who allegedly passed on the infection to her, died a few months ago because of infections generally associated with the disease.
  ,
  ,
  Now Sujatha's family members have lodged a police complaint with the One Town police station against Raju's family, alleging that he deliberately hid his HIV status at the time of marriage and infected an innocent woman. They are demanding that Raju's family bear the cost of Sujata's treatment, as she hails from a not so well-to-do family.
  ,
  ,
  ""She is on ARV (anti-retroviral drugs) and her monthly medicine bill alone comes to about Rs 3000. The drugs along with other medicines and nutritional food are very costly. She was infected by her husband and now it is their turn to take care of her,"" her mother Savitri said.
  ,
  ,
  Similar cases of persons getting married without disclosing his or her health status are on the rise. Recently, another such case came to light in a very well-known and affluent family. Luckily the bride's parents came to know about the groom's HIV positive status on the wedding morning and demanded he undergo a medical test due to which he was caught, says Dr Kutikuppla Surya Rao, a doctor who has been treating HIV/AIDS affected since the last two decades.
  ,
  ,
  But most cases do not come to light due to the stigma attached to the disease. In fact, police officials at One Town station admitted that Sujata's was the first such case to be lodged with them. ""We are aware of such things and will not hesitate to book a case but most people do not come forward as stigma of being HIV/AIDS positive still prevails. Things can change only when people come out of their shell and lodge a complaint,"" said an official of One Town police station.
  ,
  ,
  For several years, this has been the subject of a raging debate - should both the bride and the groom be made to undergo HIV/AIDS test before marriage?
  ,
  ,
  ""This issue was first raised at a NACO summit chaired by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in 2001. The discussion then moved to Parliament but never translated into an Act or rule. It has been watered down to the level that if an innocent woman or man is infected by his or her partner, then he or she can lodge a complaint in the police station or file a case for compensation or treatment charges. But that is not sufficient in the present condition,"" pointed out Dr Surya Rao.
  ,
  ,
  The medical practitioner says that such cases have been on the rise and he has seen about 30 to 40 such cases in the last two years. ""In a majority of the cases, it has been men infecting women, with just a few stray cases the other way around. And 80 per cent of them were aware of their HIV status. Being aware and then getting married is a crime. Though 2012 is considered to be a path breaking year for HIV/AIDS research as the treatment is moving from prevention phase to cure status, it is still a crime to infect another purposefully. There is, however, no problem if two positive persons get married,"" he said.
  ,
  ,
  Though as per a NACO report the prevalence of HIV/AIDS is on the decline, Dr G Prabhakar of Green Vision pointed out that the decline was being witnessed in high risk group such as commercial sex workers (CSWs), truckers and migrant workers. ""The worrying factor is that the growing promiscuity among youth has led to an upswing in the incidence of the disease in the middle and affluent classes. Though there is no survey to establish this fact, as a medical practitioner actively involved in this segment, I think there has been a growth of at least 10 per cent over the last decade,"" said Dr Prabhakar.
  ,
  ,
  ,
  ,
  ,
  On the occasion of , on Saturday, the Port City is hosting a number of awareness programmes in tune with this year's theme of 'Getting to zero'. As per the theme, the aim is to achieve zero figure in various areas such as - new HIV infections, zero discrimination and zero AIDS related deaths' for period 2011-15.
  ,
  ,
  Addressing the media here on Friday, additional district medical health officer (AIDS and Leprosy) , said that AP has around five lakh HIV positive persons, of which 5.78 per cent are from Vizag district alone.
  ,
  ,
  Kutikuppala Surya Rao, a medical practitioner, who had been treating the HIV/AIDS-infected and affected in the city, said the focus this time was on the student community to raise awareness levels as education plays a vital role in creating awareness. As part of this, a first of its kind human AIDS red ribbon chain would be formed at the campus of , at 10 am on Saturday. Apart from this, a 40 feet high burning red ribbon would be displayed there.

  Aruna Sarkar's husband Sujoy committed suicide in 1999, unable to come to terms with the fact that he was HIV positive. By then he had already passed on the virus to Aruna and the couple's only son Debaditya. On , the mother-son duo prays that no one in this world gets infected for no fault of theirs.
  ,
  ,
  Everything looked rosy for Aruna and Sujoy when they tied the knot in 1996. A few months later Sujoy left for Mumbai to work as radio officer with an oil major. He would come back to stay with his family in their Salt Lake house during leaves. It was during such trips home that his family noticed him falling ill often. Though Sujoy had got his HIV status detected in Mumbai, he did not dare share it with any of his family members, not even his wife.
  ,
  ,
  ""My husband probably could not accept that fact that he had the virus. In addition the guilt that he might have infected me and my son probably led him to commit suicide in July 1999. My son was a little less than two years then,"" Aruna recounted.
  ,
  ,
  There was worse to come. Sujoy's parents blamed Aruna for his HIV status and consequent suicide. She and the toddler were thrown out of the house. With advice from doctors, the mother-son got themselves checked and found that they were both infected. Since then they have been living with Aruna's parents in Baguiati.
  ,
  ,
  ""My world came crumbling down for the second time when we both tested positive for HIV. My son became really ill in 2004. But Dr Subhashis Bhattacharya, who works at the apex clinic in Calcutta Medical College and Hospital, came as a godsend. He not only helped us with the treatment but supported us mentally through counseling. He made us believe that AIDS is not the end of the world,"" Aruna told TOI.
  ,
  ,
  Aruna's elder brother and parents stood rock solid behind her. Aruna, who is a science graduate, gives private tuition to fund his son's education. Debaditya is preparing for his Class X board examination. ""I am very positive about life. Come what may, I do not let HIV affect my life. But I do not want my friends to come to know about it as the infection is still a taboo for many. I only wish no one gets the infection for none of their fault,"" Debaditya said.
  ,
  ,
  ""The amount of grit and courage Aruna has is incredible. In spite of being HIV-positive, she is not only bringing up her HIV-positive son single-handedly, but is also ensuring good education for him,"" said Dr Bhattacharya, a paediatric HIV specialist with NACO.
  ,
  ,
  Aruna and Debaditya are getting their anti-retroviral therapy free of cost, but she is concerned for her son's future. Often she has to seek financial help from NGOs for his education. ""The expenses of my son's education will only grow as he graduates into higher class. My earning through private tuitions is too meagre and irregular at times. I want a job but I do not know who would offer me one. Also will any organisation give me a job if they know my HIV status?"" wondered Aruna.
  ,
  ,
  While teaching the chapter on HIV in biology Aruna does not forget to tell her students never to indulge in unprotected sex. ""I make it a point to stress upon the fact that none should have unprotected sex as it is a major source for HIV transmission. I do not want anyone to undergo the hardship I am going through. I can fight but not everyone might have the strength to do so,"" she added.

Further, the number of children and adults undergoing ART doubled between January 2010 and 2012. , (GSACS) officials said this was because of increased surveillance and more nodal centres.

  Statistics of the , (GSACS) show 14 persons contracted the virus up to October this year as against four persons in the corresponding period last year; a rise of over 300%. The state's , body for control of , in Goa, incidentally, doesn't receive data of blood tests done at private laboratories, so the numbers-including the overall for the state-could be higher, said officials.
  ,
  ,
  The only other taluka to see a rise in HIV numbers this year is Ponda-two up from 26 recorded last year. Most of the other 11 talukas have seen declines.
  ,
  ,
  Commenting on Canacona's rise in numbers, GSACS project director Dr , said the tourist-centric beaches in the taluka-Palolem and Galgibaga-could have contributed to the overall numbers. The coastal belts of the state have always been considered very vulnerable to the virus.
  ,
  ,
  Remarkable declines in numbers were recorded in Salcete (52; down 34 from last year's 86), Mormugao (77; down 37 from last year's 114), Tiswadi (33; down 26 from 59), Quepem (10; down nine from 19) and Pernem (4; down seven from 11).

  Eighty-one persons-57 men, 23 , and a transgender person-succumbed to AIDS between January and September 2012 as against 90 who died between January and December 2011.

  Desai stressed that HIV cases have been on a decline in Goa for the last four years. While around 1,019 persons contracted the virus in 2008, the numbers dropped to 959 in 2009, 821 in 2010 and 665 in 2011.

  Considerable declines in HIV prevalence have been recorded among female sex workers at national level (5.06% in 2007 to 2.67% in 2011) and in most of the states, where long-standing targeted interventions have focused on behaviour change and increase in condom use. Declines have been achieved among men who have sex with men (7.41% in 2007 to 4.43% in 2011) also, though several pockets in the country show higher HIV prevalence among them with mixed results.

  The report says that scale up of free anti retroviral treatment (ART) since 2004 has saved over 1.5 lakh lives till last year.

  At the current pace of scale up of ART services, it is estimated to avert around 50,000-60,000 deaths annually in the next five years.

  Azad told TOI, ""India's progress in controlling the deadly virus has been remarkable. China, India and South , are the only three countries which have witnessed a fall in new HIV cases by over 50%. The recent UN general assembly on HIV unanimously hailed these countries for such progress.""

  In 2011, among the states, Manipur has shown the highest estimated adult HIV prevalence of 1.22%, followed by Andhra Pradesh (0.75%), Mizoram (0.74%), Nagaland (0.73%), Karnataka (0.52%), Goa (0.43%) and Maharashtra (0.42%).
  ,
  ,
  Besides these, Odisha, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, and Chandigarh have shown estimated adult HIV prevalence greater than the national prevalence at 0.27%.

  The study said, ""The adult HIV prevalence at national level has continued its steady decline from estimated level of 0.41% in 2001 through 0.35% in 2006 to 0.27% in 2011. Similar consistent declines are noted among both males and females at national level.""

  ,
  About 1.48 lakh people died of AIDS-related causes in India last year. Deaths among HIV infected children account for 7% of all AIDS-related deaths. Wider access to ART has led to 29% reduction in estimated annual AIDS-related deaths during NACP-III period (2007-2011).

  ,
  Thanks to fall in India's HIV numbers, south-east Asia (11 countries, including India) has seen a 35% dip in new HIV infections, from 3.2 lakhs (2001) to 2.08 lakhs (2011). According to the , (WHO), the HIV epidemic is clearly reversing. In 2011, 2.2 million people across the world were infected with HIV and 1.7 million died, half a million fewer new infections than 10 years ago, and 6 lakhs fewer deaths than 2005. However, the global health watch dog said the region also faces serious challenges. In the region, 46% of adults in need of treatment were enrolled in care and treatment by the end of 2011 - up from 12% in 2005. The coverage for HIV treatment in children is 39% in 2011 - up from 9% in 2005. Starting treatment early reduces morbidity and mortality due to HIV, and recent studies have also confirmed the prevention benefits of early treatment in uninfected regular sexual partners of HIV-infected individuals.
  ,
  ,
  ""The overall decline in the region is cause for increased optimism, however complacency now could become our greatest enemy,"" said Dr Samlee Plianbangchang, regional director of WHO south-east Asia.

"Padmini Sivarajah,Updated: Dec 2, 2012, 05:17 IST",HIV positive children cry for attention,"

  MADURAI: Five-year-old , (name changed), a UKG student, is today a bubbly girl who is the cynosure of all eyes at the ,, where she lives along with 10 other HIV positive parentless boys and girls. But her early childhood was one of hardship and there are many out in the community in want of attention.
  
  ,
  According to ,, founder-director of Russ Foundation, each of these children have a story of their own, but have successfully come out of their trauma and are doing well in the mainstream education system. Chittu for example was born to a female sex worker who made her income on the streets of Madurai. The woman who had a partner who was already married and had two children, was being used by him to make money. When she became sick and realized she was going to die of AIDS, she brought her three-year-old child, who was already begging on the streets of Madurai, to the home for adoption. She died a few days later. Her partner, however, who could not prove that he was the biological father of this child, was reluctant to give up the child because he had already chalked out plans to make money by making her beg. ""We went through a tough battle with him before the authorities handed her over to us,"" said Jose.
  ,
  ,
  Initially, the girl's stomach which was used to scavenging on food on the roadside, could not tolerate the well cooked warm food offered at the home. This HIV positive child suffered frequent bouts of diarrhoea. Staff at the home sometimes found her searching garbage bins for food and feeding on leftovers. ""It took us two whole months to bring her around and now she is doing very well in a normal school,"" he said.
  ,
  ,
  Apart from the children of the home, the foundation also works with 77 HIV positive children living in the community and about 650 non-infected children of HIV positive parents.
  ,
  ,
  This foundation has been able to successfully integrate HIV positive girls and boys into mainstream society, by their regular counseling and life skills classes. But according to Jose, girls more than boys face a lot of trauma on attaining puberty because society tries to stigmatize them as immoral persons. ""This is when they start hating their parents who are no longer alive. These girls become suicidal and depressed and need a lot of handholding to start realizing their potential as good individuals in society,"" he said.
  ,
  ,
  Boys on the other hand start thinking of life ahead and a future. Kumar, a boy who was expelled from a home for his mischief, is today a sturdy 18-year-old pursuing his SSLC at this home. He is also a caring brother to the smaller children; he wants to take up a career as a mechanical engineer. Selvam on the other hand who was brought to the home by his grandmother and aunt because his other relatives did not want him among them has no wish to study. But he is good with gadgets and wants to look after his grandmother and aunt well.
  ,
  ,
  On ,, these children had a feast with 800 others to celebrate the occasion and look forward to life ahead.
  ,
  ,
  Jose says it is encouraging that the incidence of HIV/AIDS has come down in the state but added that the government should formulate a policy for the care and support for persons living with HIV/AIDS. ""In no way should AIDS control programmes be relaxed because there are many who still have not been brought back into mainstream society,"" he adds.

  RAIPUR: When Rupali married Abhinav (both names changed) a few years ago, she was dreaming, just like any other girl of her age, of a happy married life and having children. However, her world literally fell apart when after few months of marriage, her husband tested positive for HIV.
  
  ,
  Her fears of having been infected by her husband proved incorrect when she tested negative. Many thoughts, including deserting Abhinav, crossed her mind then but she was truly in love with him. In her own words the ""thought of letting a virus ruin her married life was just not correct"". Though she decided to stay with Abhinav, her dreams of having children were shattered as unprotected sex with her husband could not only put her at risk of contracting the disease but could also infect the child that she desperately wanted. The couple had given up all hopes till someone told them that it might be possible for them to have their child through the assisted in-vitro fertilization (IVF) reproduction technique.
  ,
  ,
  After consultations with city-based doctors the couple went ahead with IVF and is now expecting their first child in another two months. ""We are praying that the child is free from HIV"", they say.
  ,
  ,
  While they may have some doubts, the doctors who carried out the procedure on them are however confident that the child would be ""normal and healthy"". However, they refused to disclose the name of nursing home as such patients object on it.
  ,
  ,
  Dr ,, a leading city-based practitioner, said that world over, more than 400 cases have been documented where couples, with HIV positive husbands, have successfully had children through IVF/IUI technique. ""We have also used the same technique on several couples and are sure that their child too would be healthy"", she says.
  ,
  ,
  Elaborating, Dr Pahalajani said, however in IVF- ICSI (intra-cytoplasmic sperm injection) technique, the husband's semen, which carries the infection, is washed thoroughly using specific medical solutions and one single sperm is picked to fertilize the egg. The embryo is subsequently transferred into the mother's womb. But it is not 100% risk free. So they can also adopt other procedure of donor's sperm.

  Dr Pahalajani says with acceptance about HIV growing in the society, it is the responsibility of the medical fraternity to offer solutions to the HIV-infected couples to raise healthy families.

  According to the recently concluded HIV Sentinel Surveillance 2010-11, national prevalence among adults (15-49 years) dipped to 0.27% but the positivity in the state hovered around 0.42%.
  ,
  ,
  In fact, Maharashtra, with six other states, accounted for 31% new infections in the two years since the previous study. Agencies working for HIV prevention in the state attributed the high prevalence to migration.

  His biggest worry remains HIV prevalence among men having sex with men (MSM) and intravenous drug users (IDU). The national average for MSM is 4.43% but it's almost a steep 10% in the state.

  Experts say Mumbai plays a huge role. Though there is no official confirmation, the prevalence of HIV among MSM in the city is believed to be above 12%. Worse, among transgenders, the prevalence stands at an astounding 18.80%.

  ,
  For intravenous drug users, the state average for HIV/AIDS prevalence stood at 14.17%, double the national average of 7.14%. Overall, reduction in HIV cases among IDUs at the national level has not been significant. It has dipped from 7.23% in 2007 to 7.14% in 2011.

  Although his mother, Kamala (name changed) donated one of her kidneys to her first-born son in operations held on February 1, the family had to wait for seven months to complete the paperwork needed for the transplant. ""I live in Mumbai while my mother lives in Azamgarh district in Uttar Pradesh. We went back and forth several times in this period to get the paperwork done,'' he said.
  ,
  ,
  The delay was caused mainly due to the stringent transplant rules. ""Here, a mother has given a kidney to her son. As per the transplant Act, this is a familial transplant and doesn't require any no-objection certificate,'' said Dr Rushi Deshpande, who is Singh's nephrologist. But Maharashtra government rules require an NOC even in case of families when the donor is from outside the state. In fact, the matter is being heard by the Bombay high court following a petition filed by a nephrologist protesting against this rule.

  ""The hospital had told us five months back that my husband is healthy enough to undergo a transplant, but the paperwork delayed us immensely,'' said Singh's wife. She was particularly worried about his counts falling due to his , status. ""Even though his HIV specialist Dr J K Maniar managed to keep his counts well, it was difficult for us to find a hospital that was willing to conduct his dialysis. We were charged extra for each session because of his condition,'' she added.

  On February 1, after 17 days of preparation and a seven-month wait, the operation was carried out. ""The most difficult aspect of a transplant for an HIV-positive patient is the tightrope walk between avoiding rejection and complex infections (due to HIV).

  MUMBAI: The dreaded combo of HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) and tuberculosis, one of the leading killers in patients, finally seems to be coming under control in Mumbai. The city has recorded a remarkable dip in the number of cross-infections and the success has been attributed to early detection and awareness.
  
  ,
  HIV, per se, does not kill but rather makes the body vulnerable to opportunistic infections by lowering immunity. Tuberculosis takes the top spot as the biggest opportunistic infection and killer among HIV patients. Statistics compiled by the , (MDACS) has revealed how in the last six years the incidence of tuberculosis in HIV suspects has halved. If 15% of patients who walked in for HIV testing in 2007 were found to be suffering from TB, it came down to 7% till last year. The same trend has been witnessed in those suffering from tuberculosis. TB patients remain highly vulnerable to HIV as global numbers suggest that around 13-14% end up contracting the bacterial infection. Here too, the MDACS records show that significant improvement has been made. From an incidence of 10% TB patients contracting HIV, the percentage has come down to 3% and remained there in the last two years. Additional project director of MDACS Dr Balkrishna Adsul said increased awareness among both set of patients could be one of the main reasons.

  In immense pain and barely able to speak, Tariq was taken to a private hospital by neighbours on Wednesday. He received blood transfusion at the hospital and got his first dose of chemotherapy on Sunday. Doctors said his oral cancer needs greater attention now, for his HIV is under control. ""HIV might have triggered the oral cancer. Often, it causes lymphoma, oral cancer or cancer in the genitals. But contrary to what he was told at the government hospital, Tariq's ulcer needs to be treated now. It seems he was shooed away due to his HIV status,"" said Ashish Mukhopadhyay, who is treating him. Although his condition was serious, Tariq was still in a state to receive palliative therapy that could keep him reasonably healthy for a few more years, he added.

  ,
  Deserted by his wife, Tariq is now looked after by his two brothers. He has not been able to work for the last six months. ""With each passing month, he has been getting weaker. As if the HIV was not bad enough, he got oral cancer six months ago. The pain has been excruciating and he has barely been able to eat. But the treatment at the government hospitals was shocking. They just refused to treat him,"" said Mohammed Moin, his brother-in-law.

  ,
  RG Kar authorities, on the other hand, argued that HIV-positive patients are often asked to continue treatment for the virus when they seek redress for another ailment.
  ,
  ,
  ""As the rules say, HIV patients are treated on a par with others. We are not permitted to disclose their HIV status even to the hospital staff. But we must handle them carefully, for they are carrying a contagious virus. So, we often advise them to make sure that they continue their treatment for HIV and are referred to our HIV centre. Strangely, patients often take this as refusal. I am not aware of Tariq's case, but it seems unlikely that he was shooed away just because he had the disease. At any given point of time, RG Kar has at least 8 to 10 HIV patients who are being treated alongside the rest,"" said Ajoy Ray, medical superintendent of RG Kar.

  ,
  The , said it was illegal to either refuse treatment or turn away an HIV patient. ""In case we receive a complaint, we shall investigate the matter,"" said Himadri Sekhar Sanyal, the deputy project manager of the society.

  Mukhopadhyay pointed out that while Tariq needed to carry on his HIV treatment, his oral cancer (buccalmucosa carcinoma) was worsening and might have caused death. ""Without chemotherapy, he wouldn't have survived more than a few months more,"" he said.

  BELGAUM: Here is some cheering news. The number of , positive cases has come down drastically in the district due to awareness among people. Prevention of Parent to Children Transmission Programme has yielded good results.

  In the past three years, the HIV positive cases have come down in both pregnant women and the public.

  ,
  ,
  Dr Balakrishna N Tukkar of District ,, Belgaum district, said: ""Thanks to awareness, pregnant women come voluntarily for the test now, which was not the case six to seven years back. With the help of central and state governments and with the support from NGOs, we conducted various awareness programmes like street plays, counselling of sex workers and competitions in schools and colleges. Once the patients are tested HIV positive, we conduct pre- and post- counselling. There are five ART centres in Belgaum district, each in Belgaum, Savadatti, Chikkodi, Athani and Gokak taluk. Patiensts are given free tablets at these centres.''

  He added: ""After the government launched the Parent to Children Transmission Programme in 2006, the number of children succumbing to HIV positive due to mother has come down drastically. Under this programme, anti-retroviral tablets are given to pregnant women who are tested HIV positive from their fourth month of pregnancy. Through this, even if a mother is HIV positive, the baby will not get it.''

  The NGOs also play a pivotal role. They keep track of the patients. If they discontinue tablets, they counsel them and get them to ART Centre and give the tablets.

  Vishram Meena, RSRTC executive director said, ""The passes which will be issued to PLHIV, will not have HIV written in them.
  ,
  ,
  In all the passes, the category of the persons availing the benefit will be mentioned on the smart cards, but in case of PLHIV, there will be no mention of HIV in the smart cards.""
  ,
  ,
  Moreover, the Rajasthan State Aids Control Society (RSACS) claimed that one PLHIV needs to travel for around 18 times per year to get medicines between Anti-Retroviral Therapy (ART) centers and the patient's home. The RSRTC provides 75% concession on fare for travel. At the ART centers, the PLHIV get medicines free of cost that are provided by the RSACS.

The blood-brain barrier keeps most medicines from reaching the brain. Most antiretroviral therapies used to treat HIV are deposited in the liver, lungs and other organs before they reach the brain. ""This allows HIV to lurk unchecked ,"" said Nair.

  Sister Britto, the director of Snehadeep Centre of the Holy Cross Community Care Centre and Hospital, over 15 km from Hazaribag, said the they provided medicines, food and accommodation to 40 to 50 patients suffering from HIV. ""But now, we have been compelled to withdraw the facilities as the Naco felt all such patients should go to the ART Centre functioning on the Sadar Hospital campus.""
  ,
  ,
  The funds provided by the Naco up to March 31 have stopped, she said. More than 90% HIV patients admitted to the centre were discharged as there was no money to meet the expenses of the patients.
  ,
  ,
  Since the treatment facility started in 2005, the centre has treated 3,431 patients. However, the Holy Cross Society has started taking care of poor and critical patients by meeting 50% of the expenses incurred on these patients on humanitarian grounds. The remaining 50% of the expenses are met by the suffering patients with great difficulties. Sister Britto said despite some assistance from the Society, they were compelled to release two doctors and seven nurses whose salaries were paid from the funds provided by the Naco. The number of HIV patients in Hazaribag district has gone up to 1,799.

  MADURAI: In a landmark order, the , of the , has granted divorce to a man on the ground that his wife was ,, equating the condition to a venereal disease.
  
  ,
  ,
  ""When a spouse is HIV-positive, the other spouse is entitled for divorce under the Hindu Marriage Act,"" Justice R S Ramanathan ruled last week. Passing orders on the appeal filed by lorry driver P Ravikumar, the judge said that in 1955 when the , came into existence, HIV was not heard of. However, as per Section 13(v) of the Act if a spouse is suffering from a venereal disease in a communicable form, it is a valid ground for divorce, he said.
  ,
  ,
  Justice Ramanathan, noting that he had perused materials available on the internet, concluded that HIV infection being a communicable health hazard, a person testing positive for the virus should be considered an acceptable ground for divorce.
  ,
  ,
  ""In the year 1955, HIV was not heard of and, therefore, it was not named in the Hindu Marriage Act as one of the grounds for dissolution of marriage. But having regard for the fact that venereal disease in a communicable form has been mentioned as one of the grounds for divorce, any such disease will also come under the provision of , 13(v). Therefore, it cannot be contended that HIV-positive condition is not included under the section and therefore divorce cannot be granted,"" Justice Ramanathan said.
  ,
  ,
  The matter relates to the matrimonial dispute between the couple from Sankagiri in Salem district. On an application from Ravikumar, a sub-court dissolved their marriage on April 3, 2007. However, hearing the appeal filed by his wife, the additional district court in Salem on January 31, 2008 ruled that divorce cannot be granted. Ravikumar then approached the high court.
  ,
  ,
  When the matter was taken up for hearing, his wife's counsel denied that she was HIV-positive and argued that since her husband was a driver visiting various places during his duty, if at all she is afflicted with HIV, she must have got it only through her husband. While the Hindu Marriage Act had specifically stated that venereal diseases in a communicable form could be a ground for divorce, it had not said anywhere that HIV-positive condition could be a ground for dissolution of a marriage. The divorce plea of Ravikumar, therefore, is not maintainable, she submitted.
  ,
  ,
  However, when the court asked the couple to undergo tests at the Government , in Chennai, Ravikumar alone complied with the order. His wife refused to undergo any tests voluntarily, despite two directives from the court.

  LONDON: Scientists have for the first time peeled open the virus — that can lead to , — from its shell raising giving a priceless insight into how it can be stopped from infecting millions across the globe every year.
  
  ,
  A team of researchers from the , have announced that they have peeled open ,'s outer coating and discovered 4-million-atom structure inside the protein shell.
  ,
  ,
  The findings, researchers say will ultimately lead the way to fending off an often-changing virus that has been very hard to conquer.
  ,
  ,
  It's been 30 years since the AIDS epidemic spread to every corner of the world killing nearly 30 million people, infecting more than 60 million. There is still no vaccine or cure for it
  ,
  ,
  Scientists say developing an effective vaccine to prevent HIV infection is one of the most daunting challenges ever faced. One of the main reason for this is that HIV is an incredibly elusive virus.
  ,
  ,
  HIV is among the most mutating viruses.
  ,
  ,
  Scientists have long struggled to decipher how the HIV capsid shell is chemically put together.
  ,
  ,
  Senior author Peijun Zhang, department of structural biology, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine said, ""The capsid is critically important for ,, so knowing its structure in detail could lead us to new drugs that can treat or prevent the infection,"" she said.
  ,
  ,
  ""This approach has the potential to be a powerful alternative to our current HIV therapies, which work by targeting certain enzymes, but drug resistance is an enormous challenge due to the virus' high mutation rate.""
  ,
  ,
  Previous research has shown that the cone-shaped shell is composed of identical capsid proteins linked together in a complex lattice.
  ,
  ,
  But the shell is non-uniform and asymmetrical; uncertainty remained about the exact number of proteins involved and how the hexagons of six protein subunits and pentagons of five subunits are joined.
  ,
  ,
  Standard structural biology methods to decipher the molecular architecture were insufficient because they rely on averaged data, collected on samples of pieces of the highly variable capsid to identify how these pieces tend to go together.
  ,
  ,
  ""The capsid is very sensitive to mutation, so if we can disrupt those interfaces, we could interfere with capsid function,"" Dr Zhang said. ""The capsid has to remain intact to protect the HIV genome and get it into the human cell, but once inside it has to come apart to release its content so that the virus can replicate. Developing drugs that cause capsid dysfunction by preventing its assembly or disassembly might stop the virus from reproducing.""
  ,
  ,
  ""By using a combination of experimental and computational approaches, this team of investigators has produced a clearer picture of the structure of HIV's protective covering,"" said the National Institutes of Health's Michael Sakalian.
  ,
  ,
  ""The new structural details may reveal vulnerabilities that could be exploited by future therapeutics.""

His abdomen was cut in such a way that his intestines were visible. Immediate medical attention failed to revive him. Police suspect the 46-year-old patient committed suicide. A case of unnatural death was registered and the body sent for autopsy.
  
  ,
  The patient from Narkeldanga was detected HIV-positive a couple of years ago. For the past eight months, he was undergoing Anti-Retroviral Therapy (ART) at Medical College and Hospital Calcutta. But because of his irregular visits to the hospital for the therapy, his CD4 count dropped drastically following which he was rushed to the medical college last month.
  ,
  ,
  The man was taken home after he became stable and admitted to STM two weeks back since he had become anaemic and was suffering from bouts of diarrhoea.
  ,
  ,
  The victim's family members said that he would often skip medicines and needed constant monitoring. His son was hence staying with him so that he could be looked after properly.
  ,
  ,
  According to the patient's son, he had fed him and given him all necessary medicines before putting him to sleep around 12 midnight. The son also slept thereafter. At 4.30am, he was woken up by a groaning sound and found his father lying on the floor with blood all around. His abdomen was split open and the intestines visible. A knife brought by the son to cut fruits was used to cut open the abdomen, said police.
  ,
  ,
  ""Though the doctors attended to him immediately, the patient couldn't be revived as he had lost a lot of blood and the injury was grievous. He succumbed to the injury an hour later,"" said Dr Pradip Kumar Kundu, STM medical superintendent and vice principal.
  ,
  ,
  The patient was depressed and suffering from dementia, said doctors. Police believe he was unable to bear the sufferings and hence killed himself. ""The nature of injury appears to be self inflicted. We can confirm if it was suicide or homicide once we get the autopsy report,"" said a senior police officer of the detective department.

Despite giving all emergency medical attention, the man succumbed to the injury.
  ,
  ,
  According to the son, he has fed his father and given all medications before putting him to sleep around 12 midnight. The son also slept after that. Around 4.30 am he was awakened by the sound of groaning. He woke up to find his father on the floor will blood all around. To the shock of the doctors who rushed in they found the abdomen of the patient slit deep and wide and his intestine had popped out.
  ,
  ,
  ""He was attended immediately by our doctors. But the patient had lost so much of blood and the injury was so grievous that he could not revived. He succumbed to the injury about an hour later,"" said Dr Pradip Kumar Kundu, STM medical superintendent and vice principal.
  ,
  ,
  The patient was detected HIV positive a couple of years ago. He was on ART drugs for about eight months from Medical College and Hospital Calcutta. But due to his irregularities in going for the ART his CD 4 count had come down drastically as a result he was rushed to the said hospital about a month ago. He was then discharged after being treated for about a week. His family brought him to STM two weeks ago as he had become anaemic and suffered from bouts of diarrhoea.
  ,
  ,
  Family members said that the patient would skip medications if he was not monitored by someone. That is how his son stayed with him in the hospital to look after him. Doctors treating him also said that the patient was depressed and was also suffering from dementia. His condition had started improving slightly in the past one week.
  ,
  ,
  A knife brought by the son to cut fruit for the patient was used to cut open the abdomen of the patient. Police suspects that he was unable to bear with sufferings and hence took his own life.
  ,
  ,
  ""The nature of injury appears to be self inflicted and hence it looks like a case of suicide. However whether it was suicide or homicide will be confirmed once we get the autopsy report,"" said a senior police officer of the detective department.

  MANGALORE: The response for the scheme of reimbursing , for ,, who visit , (ART) centres for therapy, has been good in Dakshina Kannada. The scheme was launched by the department of health and family welfare and Karnataka State Aids Prevention Society (KSAPS) in January 2013.
  
  ,
  ,
  Before the launch of this scheme, many poor HIV patients, mainly those residing in rural areas, did not visit ART centres regularly for treatment as they couldn't afford the travel fare from their homes to the centres. Six ART centres are situated in different parts of DK district, including two centres in Mangalore city. Dr Kishore Kumar, DK district AIDS control officer, told TOI that an average of 60 HIV patients visit each ART centre a day for treatment. There are 1,600 patients registered in ART centres which provide free treatment, he said.
  ,
  ,
  Before the travel fare reimbursement fee scheme was introduced, around 20 patients were skipping their regular visits to ART centres every day. But in the past few months, this number has come down to three, he added.
  ,
  ,
  ""Last year, when we contacted patients about why they weren't visiting ART centres, they'd say they cannot afford the travel expense,"" said Dr Kishore. He said patients who travel from rural areas to ART centres are reimbursed 80 paisa per kilometre to and fro, while patients within city limits are given Rs 40.
  ,
  ,
  After undergoing treatment, patients' travel expenses are reimbursed at the ART centres. Expenses are also reimbursed for one caretaker who accompanies any HIV patients under 10 years or over 60 years of age, said Dr Kishore.
  ,
  ,
  Urging patients to make use of the scheme and free treatment, he said they have to visit the centres once a month. Missing out on a monthly visit is dangerous as it could lead to resistance towards the drug.

"Jun 12, 2013, 06:08 IST",Chennai-Yale study pitches for universal HIV test to cut cost,"

  LONDON: Testing every person in India's billion plus population for HIV will be cost effective, the first ever study on the benefit of universal HIV testing has found.
  
  ,
  A team of researchers from YRG Care in Chennai, Massachusetts General Hospital, and Brown, Yale and Harvard universities in the US has determined that providing universal HIV testing every five years would be a cost-effective approach to managing the epidemic. The finding was published on Tuesday in the journal PLoS One.
  ,
  ,
  Testing the general population just once would cost $1,100 (approx 65,000) per year of life saved (YLS) in the general population, and $800 (47,000) per YLS among high-risk groups. Testing the population every five years would cost $1,900 (1.1lakh) per YLS saved in for the general public, and $1,300 (76,000) per YLS among high-risk groups.
  ,
  ,
  Researchers said the main benefit of national testing would be getting more people to learn they are positive and therefore to seek effective care. A secondary benefit would be to curb transmission of the virus.
  ,
  ,
  According to the team, the main results are projections of the dollar cost per year of extended life. The World Health Organization's standard for cost effectiveness is an expenditure that is less than three times the per capita GDP of a country.
  ,
  ,
  In India in 2010, per capita GDP was $1,300. A programme is therefore cost-effective in India if the expense is less than $3,900 (2.2lakh) to save a year of someone's life.
  ,
  ,
  They calculated that modern antiretroviral therapies can give HIV-positive people a normal lifespan. In India, which has a thriving generic pharmaceutical sector, first-line therapy costs only $8.61 (500) a month. HIV tests cost only $3.33 (195).
  ,
  ,
  The team coded several other parameters into the model including what percentage of people would refuse the test (18%), how many patients who test positive would get care (50%), the prevalence of HIV in the population (0.29%) and others.
  ,
  ,
  Jessica Becker of Yale University said, ""We were able to show that even if you increase the cost of HIV treatment and care significantly, testing this frequently was reasonable.""
  ,
  ,
  Co-author Dr Soumya Swaminathan, director of the National Institute for Research in Tuberculosis in Chennai, said the projections will help the country in its battle with the epidemic.
  ,
  ,
  ""As India moves ahead in its HIV prevention activities and aims for zero new infections, expanding testing will be a priority and this analysis should help policymakers make the best decisions,"" she said.

  ALLAHABAD: Officials of District Aids Programme Control Unit (DAPCU) swung into action following the report filed by National Aids Control Organisation (NACO) terming around 132 villages as sensitive to HIV transmission. The UP State Aids Control Society (UPSACS) has now launched an extensive educational and awareness campaign with special attention on migrants.
  
  ,
  This extensive drive has been launched after five districts of UP including Allahabad, Mau, Deoria, Etawah and Banda were placed under 'category A' in terms of migration of , infected persons. Subsequently NACO is carrying out a special campaign in identified villages between June 13 and 27.
  ,
  ,
  NACO has also decided to carry out fourth phase of AIDS control programme in UP from October this year. According to the report, a total of 183 districts across the nation have been placed under 'category A' by NACO.
  ,
  ,
  Nodal officer, DAPCU, Dr OP Shahi told TOI that ""We have been carrying out extensive awareness campaign through 'folk art' to capture people's attention. Folk art like nukkad natak, nautanki, magic show, puppetry and kabbali are the best source of spreading awareness among people.""
  ,
  ,
  He further added that under the first phase, awareness and educational camps will be held in 100 villages while remaining villages would be covered under the second phase.
  ,
  ,
  Dr Rohit Pandey, district programme manager, AIDS programme said that special camps are being held in 100 identified villages from June 13 to 27 while mass awareness camps in the same villages would be held between June 20 and July 4, 2013. He added that five villages each from 20 blocks of the district have been selected for awareness and educational progammes wherein migrants are being apprised about it too. Even as the officials will be collecting data of number patients from all 20 blocks of the district, they will also be carrying out an intensive drive to check the health status of migrants and identify their locations with an aim to offer them counseling and treatment. Meanwhile, they will also be conducting studies regarding the migration pattern and prevalence of HIV.
  ,
  ,
  As far as route of infection and transmission categories are concerned, in 85.3 per cent cases, the disease spreads due to unsafe sexual contact, while 3.80 per cent, 2.05 per cent, 3.34 per cent and 6.46 per cent cases are due to prenatal transmission, blood transfusion, injectable drug users respectively.
  ,
  ,
  Dr Shahi claimed under the directives of NACO and UPACS, district health authorities will be identifying those migrant labourers, truckers and homosexuals in the district as they are more vulnerable to the disease. Officials are also mapping high-risk groups like female sex workers, intravenous drug users and homosexuals, so that concrete measures can be initiated to restrict the , of the virus. UPSACS officials have also been conducting awareness programmes under the information, education and communication (IEC) programme.

  AHMEDABAD: An expert committee has opined that the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test to detect HIV infection should not be made mandatory for all licensed blood banks due to lack of infrastructure and expertise in the country, but conceded that the test can be conducted at select centres.
  
  ,
  The union ministry for health and the family welfare department along with , Aids Control Organization (NACO) formed an expert committee to look into the issue. This was on the basis of a Gujarat High Court order passed on November 8 last year in a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) demanding that the PCR test or the Nucleic Acid Amblification Test (NAAT) should be made mandatory in lieu of Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (,) for detection of HIV infection. The PIL argued that the PCR test reduces the 'window period,' that is, the time period the body takes to produce antibodies in response to HIV infection, also the time period during which the HIV virus is undetectable.
  ,
  ,
  The committee was asked to recommend the extent to which PCR test should be made mandatory at all licensed blood banks. It submitted its report on Thursday with conclusions and recommendations.
  ,
  ,
  The committee has concluded that the NAAT can at best be an add-on test of HIV screening along with routine mandated antibody screening tests by immunoassay. NAAT is technically demanding and our blood banks are not adequately equipped to carry it out for routine purposes. It also said that NAAT assays may not provide zero risk for acquiring transfusion transmitted infections (TTI) as it does not completely eliminate the window period.
  ,
  ,
  After listing out eight reasons why PCR cannot be made mandatory in India, the experts recommended that it should not be made compulsory for all blood banks, since the high turnaround time in screening donated blood may lead to a delay in utilization and may compromise accessibility of blood and blood components. Moreover, its introduction would necessitate amendment in the regulatory framework.
  ,
  ,
  The expert group further opined that since there is insufficient data on the additional yield of TTI viral markers as well as operational and technical feasibility in India, selected centres may be identified to conduct this test.

  A further hearing on this issue will be held next Thursday.

On July 7, 2010, he took her call but told her he would not take her back, without explanation. The medical test report of July 7, 2010 confirmed Joan was cured of typhoid and tests included for HIV antibodies.

  ,
  In his application before the FC, Joel gave many reasons, including fever, tiredness, body ache, dry cough, diarrhoea, abdominal pain and headache. He said Joan had a bloated abdomen although her face, hands and legs were very thin and due to this she wore long outfits. ""On an official website of HIV, it is documented that HIV is medically caused due to accumulation of fat in the stomach,'' he stated. He said she spoke in her sleep using the words 'HIV' and 'AIDS' and mentioned 'Jack Dorsan', who he found on the Internet was in the prostitution business. He said his wife had stored Dorsan's telephone number and spoke to him on the day of their wedding.

  Following opposition by parents of around 17 students at Amboli village government primary school, the orphaned HIV+ girls could not attend school for almost a month. The district administration has, however, adopted a tough stance and deployed police bandobast at the school premises from Saturday.

  NEW DELHI: For several years, Asha Jat was just a 27-year-old homemaker from Ajmer who had tested , and was shunned by society. Then four years ago, she was introduced to a health project that helps HIV positive mothers avail medical assistance for themselves and their child. Now Asha is one of the 25 volunteers for the project in Rajasthan's Ajmer district and has facilitated 102 childbirths of HIV positive women in the last four years.
  ,
  ,
  The project titled, Reduction of Parent to Child Transmission of HIV in India: Improving access of Positive Women to Public Health Services (,), was launched in three states — Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Rajasthan in 2009. ""The project taught me to speak for myself and stand up for my rights,"" says Asha.
  ,
  ,
  Funded through European Union and Christian Aid, the project aims to contribute to the National Aids Control Programme—III's overall goal of halting and reversing the HIV epidemic in India. This was to be achieved by providing non-stigmatized PPTCT services through networks and volunteers.
  ,
  ,
  According to Asha, before the PPTCT project, women were neither able to access government health services nor opted for hospital deliveries. After the programme began, there has been a definite increase in both accessing services and hospital deliveries. ""More importantly there has been a drop in the number of children that are born HIV positive,"" says Asha, who shared her experiences at a round table meeting in the capital on Tuesday.
  ,
  ,
  District government doctors give lists of HIV positive people to PPTCT volunteers to follow-up. ""The project enables a woman or mothers to go to heath services and say ""I am HIV+, my child is negative and I need medical assistance,"" said Akhila Sivdas, executive director, Centre for Advocacy and Research (CFAR) that advocates for informed representation about gender and development issues such as HIV/AIDS, child rights and violence against marginalised groups.

  The PPTCT project was implemented by the Positive Women's Network (PWN+), a Tamil Nadu Voluntary Health Association (TNVHA), Arogya Agam, Tamil Nadu and Society for People's Action for Development (SPAD), Karnataka.
  ,
  ,
  According to Padmavati, president (PWN+) Tamil Nadu, the project is making a big difference in tribal districts such as Nilgris, Theni and Coimbatore. ""In those places the volunteers are literally the lynchpins of the programme. Every village has a volunteer network and the women, though they don't get an honorarium, are happy to work as volunteers because they have had positive children themselves and they do not want others to go through the same experience"".
  ,
  ,
  Citing a highpoint of the programme, Padmavati described how a volunteer secured 30 ration cards (a necessary document for securing various government healthcare facilities) from the Coimbatore collector for the HIV+ women of the area in a single day.
  ,
  ,
  For Gajalaxmi, Sex Workers Collective from Trichi district, the lack of such documents led to sex workers facing discriminations towards their rights and entitlements. ""If other women have to make two-three visits to avail of an entitlement, a sex worker would have to go 10-12 times. Even today 50% of them do not succeed in getting their entitlements,"" she said.

"Updated: Aug 4, 2013, 01:49 IST",'HIV mothers on ARV can breastfeed',"

  
  VISAKHAPATNAM: HIV positive mothers can , their newborns provided they are on anti-retroviral therapy (ARV) right through the pregnancy, the delivery and post-delivery period, including the breast-feeding period, to prevent vertical transmission of HIV from mother to child, say medical experts on the occasion of the World Breastfeeding Week that is being celebrated from August 1 to 7 to encourage breastfeeding.
  ,
  ,
  According to experts, the HIV positive mothers should exclusively breastfeed their children irrespective of HIV status for the first six months while non-infected mothers can breastfeed till the child reaches two years of age.
  ,
  ,
  ""NACO (National AIDS Control Organisation) recommends exclusive breastfeeding for six months and then soft, nutrient-rich homemade food during the weaning period, preferably upto two years. It has been found that the risk of transmission involved is minimal, just 2%, when the mother is on ARV using a combination drug regime,"" said Dr Jayachandra Reddy, joint director, basic services, AP State Aids Control Society (APSACS).
  ,
  ,
  ""The child is given nevirapine syrup for six weeks and then septran syrup till the 18th month in case early infant diagnosis or DNA PCR test shows that the child is HIV-negative. In case the child is found to be HIV positive, he or she is put on ARV. WHO (,) recommends alternative or replacement bottle feeding only if five factors are satisfied. These include AFASS - Affordability, Feasibility, Acceptability, Safety and Sustainability,"" said the APSACS official.
  ,
  ,
  While breast-feeding is recommended for all newborns, there has been controversy over HIV positive mothers breastfeeding their babies but this has now been dispelled with the WHO and doctors dealing with AIDS recommending breastfeeding by HIV positive mothers who are on ARV even in developing countries.
  ,
  ,
  According to Dr K Surya Rao, specialist in , medicine from Dr Kutikuppala Hospital, one has to weigh the risk and benefits while breastfeeding. ""In India, as per WHO, annually, nearly two-thirds of the over 2.4 million child deaths are related to inappropriate infant feeding practices. Due to lack of breast milk, many infants die of diarrhoea and gastroenteritis overnight. Even though there's some risk of vertical transmission involved, there are ways to prevent it too.""
  ,
  ,
  ""The mother should be on highly active ARV right from pregnancy, depending on her viral load and take a combination of drugs instead of the earlier practiced mono-therapy. The mother should also be comfortable feeding the child as per requirement. Also, a campaign needs to be undertaken, especially in rural and tribal areas regarding non-discarding the colostrum, which is a component in the mother's first milk containing high protein and antibody and boosts the immune system,"" Dr Rao explained.
  ,
  ,
  Concurring with experts, Dr Ronanki Ramesh, additional district medical and health officer (AIDS and leprosy) said, ""Mixed feeding with breast and bottle-milk should be avoided to cut down the risk of transmission. Also, in poor or developing countries, , may not have access to safe and affordable replacement feeding options and handling of milk bottles isn't hygienic and triggers more diarrhoea deaths in infants. Therefore, irrespective of the HIV status, mothers on ARV are encouraged to breastfeed their children within one hour of birth.""
  ,
  ,
  According to doctors, breastfeeding is the best way to provide ideal food for the healthy growth and development of infants as apart from creating immunity and protecting the baby from infections, it also creates a special bond between the mother and child.

  ,
  ,
  Hospital administration is also unable to clarify as to why the patient, who is unable to travel on his own, has not been provided with the ambulance facility for shifting to SSL. Ram has a severe infection in his leg and is unable to move even from his bed. Forty-year-old Ram, who is being nursed by his old mother, says, ""We cannot go to SSL. We have no money or strength to travel."" He had earlier alleged that hospital staff was discriminating against him in providing medical care. He had claimed that the para-medical staff had refused to clean his wound and dress it properly. As a result, her mother was acting as his nurse. The para-medics had claimed that Ram's case was different as he was suffering from HIV infection. ""HIV positive patients have to be attended in a different manner. We don't have any arrangement for taking care of such a patient, hence we are unable to take care of his wound,"" said para-medic Saikhu.
  ,
  ,
  The hospital's attitude towards Ram is indicative of the stigma and lack of awareness among the hospital staff regarding HIV. The National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) has clear guidelines that HIV AIDS patients are to be treated at par with general patients and without discrimination. It also does not support any separate ward for these patients. The hospital's silence over not offering any assistance in shifting the patient to BHU is also a major issue.
  ,
  ,
  Meanwhile, taking serious note of the reports of discrimination against HIV positive patient, National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) has sought a report from the Shiv Prasad Gupta (SPG) Divisional Hospital on the issue. Through a letter, the NACO has ordered officials concerned to probe into the matter and submit a report within a week.

  Accepting that such a letter has been received by the hospital administration, superintendent-in-chief (SIC), SPG Hospital, Dr VK Srivastava said, ""The patient is staying in the hospital on his own free will.

  CHENNAI: The combination of , and , doesn't just complicate treatment ; the double disease could be as dangerous as having HIV/AIDS with TB. A new study has confirmed that diabetes can make the TB bacteria harder to treat, just as HIV/AIDS does.
  
  ,
  A group of doctors from , for Diabetes, who pored over records of tuberculosis patients registered in the government's Revised National Tuberculosis Control Programme in Chennai, Tiruvallur and Kancheepuram , found that at least 50% of TB patients had diabetes or pre-diabetes .
  ,
  ,
  All patients were given medication under the DOTS (Directly Observed Treatment Short Course) programme, recommended by World Health Organisation for TB control. At the end of two months, doctors did a sputum test to see if medicines had brought down infection. Nearly 14% of patients with diabetes tested positive for TB compared to 3% of those without diabetes . After six months, doctors said 4% of TBdiabetes patients had not responded to treatment compared to 0.7% of those without diabetes.
  ,
  ,
  The effect of diabetes on TB is similar to , on TB, said diabetologist Dr Vijay Vishwanathan , who led the research team. They will urge the government to integrate national programmes for TB and diabetes. ""We must ensure that all TB patients are tested for diabetes and vice versa,"" he said. According to the Union health ministry, 40% of Indians are TB carriers. At least 10% of people in India are diabetic and in cities like Chennai the incidence is 20%.
  ,
  ,
  ""The chances of TB recurrence are higher among diabetics. We are planning a larger study to determine a new treatment regimen, including better diagnosis methods for TB-diabetes patients,"" said Dr Vishwanthan.
  ,
  ,
  National Institute for Research in Tuberculosis director Soumya Swaminathan said they did a study among 100 patients with TB and diabetes and found that if sugar levels are under control, treatment outcomes are better. ""This hardly happens. TB is diagnosed when patients are in their 40s, the same time when many learn they are diabetics as well,"" she said.

  KOLKATA: The city showed its absolute apathy and lack of sensitivity towards the 'third sex' recently when a HIV-positive eunuch had to go back without getting treatment from a government hospital.
  
  ,
  Heena (name changed to protect identity), who was suffering from urinary tract infection was taken to , on September 2. After allegedly waiting for about a week for admission, the 24-year-old was finally taken away by the community members on Tuesday. Last heard, she was on her way to a place in Bihar for 'treatment' by quacks.
  ,
  ,
  Heena's fault was that she got castrated in February this year somewhere in Bihar by 'professionals' in the community. Heena was also detected to be HIV-positive about a couple of months back. With no encouragement from the community to go to a hospital, Heena was treated by quacks for a few weeks. But when her condition deteriorated, she sought the help of Association of Trangenders and Hijras in Bengal (ATHB).
  ,
  ,
  After running from one official to another at SSKM, Heena was asked to come to the hospital on September 9. She was checked by doctors of the urology department on September 9 and advised admission. But the hospital authority said since Heena had undergone castration, she needed an order from a district judge for admission.
  ,
  ,
  ""We had no knowledge of this formality. They kept insisting that we get this order from a district judge. How could the patient get it when she herself was unable to move because of the ailment? We were worried about her condition,"" said ATHB secretary Ranjita Sinha.
  ,
  ,
  Heena's cries of pain fell on deaf ears as the hospital allegedly kept citing the legal issues. Aggravating the problem was the absence of a separate ward for the third sex. Even as some doctors were sympathetic, they too pleaded helplessness. The hospital also told them that a relative had to sign a risk bond in case admission was granted. Since Heena has no family, her 'hirja gurus' were convinced by ATHB to sign the bond. Accordingly, some from the community came to the hospital. But seeing the delay and the apathy, they took Heena away and she left for Bihar on Wednesday morning.
  ,
  ,
  In the meantime, ATHB members sought the intervention of the West Bengal State AIDs Prevention and Control Society (WBSAPCS). While some officials claimed that they were talking to hospital authorities; some pleaded that they were out of station.
  ,
  ,
  ""Some people from the eunuch community who had come to the hospital were getting impatient. They were pained by the way Heena was suffering. They lamented that they had no place in the society, even in hospitals. Despite our plea to wait for another day, they took Heena away,"" said Sinha.
  ,
  ,
  Heena is probably getting 'treatment' right now from quacks somewhere in Bihar. None from SSKM wanted to comment on the allegation. Dr D N Goswami, joint director (TI), who was constantly informed about the problem, also refused to comment saying that he was busy in a meeting. Other WBSAPCS officials, however, said they would look into the issue.
  ,

  ""I had no knowledge about this. This should not have happened. Despite our effort to create awareness and sensitivity, there is still room for improvement. We will take up the issue once we get a complaint on it,"" said Dr Himadri Shekhar Sanyal, additional project director, WBSAPCS.

  PATNA: , and Hospital (PMCH) doctors have refused to operate an HIV positive woman, much against the policy of not discriminating against such people. The victim is a 45-year-old Anita Devi of Mithapur, who was admitted to surgical emergency on September 4 vide registration number 70453. Her attendants have been asked to shift her to some private hospital.
  
  ,
  Anita is suffering from intestinal obstruction. She was admitted to surgical emergency on Thursday. ""Today the doctor came to us asking for prescription. He took it and never came back. We are only left with the prescription's photo copy,"" her son Babloo said on Friday. ""The hospital staff are asking us to leave without even discharge slip,"" Babloo said.
  ,
  ,
  Anita first went to medical OPD on August 26. Her prescription states that the patient was not passing faeces for seven days. She was prescribed medicines and asked to report after a week. The patient on September 2 came back with swelling and acute pain in abdomen. The patient was referred to medical emergency, said Babloo. On consultation in medical emergency, the doctors referred her to surgical emergency. The prescription said, ""The X-ray of the abdomen shows that the patient is having multiple air fluid level.""
  ,
  ,
  For performing surgery, a few tests were done, including an HIV test. ""On finding my mother HIV positive, they tore the prescription and asked us to take her to any private hospital,"" said Babloo.
  ,
  ,
  Babloo took her mother home but returned to surgical emergency on September 4. ""However, the doctors refused surgery again, saying no doctor will risk his or her own life. When I requested them, they abused and manhandled me,"" said Babloo, who works as a peon in an apartment and earns Rs 4,000 per month. Anita was finally admitted to Dr J P Gupta's unit in surgical emergency on Thursday.
  ,
  ,
  When contacted by TOI, Dr C M Jha, chief medical officer of the emergency, expressed ignorance about any such patient. , Dr Amarkant Jha 'Amar'' said, ""It was unfortunate. The case will be looked into tomorrow."" He redirected the reporter to deputy superintendent Dr Bimal Karak as he was not on duty. Dr Karak wondered why were the doctors refusing to operate since ""the special kit for performing surgery on HIV positive people that ensures doctors' safety is available with the hospital.""

  PATNA: , (PMCH) has finally taken a number of steps to treat , patients. The hospital administration has also 'instructed' the blood bank officials to provide blood to such patients without asking for replacement blood.
  ,
  ,
  PMCH's deputy superintendent Dr Bimal Karak said, ""Operation on HIV+ patients are performed as per the requirement. I have now proposed that such patients be operated every Saturday, so that other operations are not affected. An OT has to be fumigated for 24 hours after operating an HIV patient and it can't be used for that duration. The hospital superintendent will take a final call on this proposal.""
  ,
  ,
  To remove doctors' reservation over operating on such patients, safety kits have already been provided to all the departments. If a doctor gets a nick during the operation, certain medicines have also been provided to undo its effect, Dr Karak said.
  ,
  ,
  He added, ""The state government's order to give blood to HIV+ patients without replacement blood has been implemented with immediate effect."" It will be the duty of the medical officer concerned to see that the blood supplied by the blood bank is given to the patient before its expiry period of five hours. This will ensure that the blood is not wasted, said Dr Karak.
  ,
  ,
  It may be mentioned here that the attendants of a 45-year-old HIV+ woman, who died in PMCH on September 9, had alleged that they could not get blood on time despite being ready to provide replacement blood. The doctors treating the woman had also said that the woman required urgent transfusion of blood.
  ,
  ,
  The blood bank's chief medical officer, Dr U P Singh, claimed this instruction was being followed even earlier. Asked why was that woman then denied blood, he said, ""I didn't see the woman's prescription which said that she was HIV positive. Had I known it, replacement blood would not have been demanded.""

"Updated: Sep 20, 2013, 15:02 IST",New molecule design prompts HIV to kill itself,"

  WASHINGTON: , in suicide mode! In a breakthrough, researchers, including an Indian-origin scientist, have created a , that can trick HIV into killing itself without disturbing any healthy cells.
  
  ,
  Pinning down an effective way to combat the spread of the human immunodeficiency virus, the viral precursor to AIDS, has long been a challenge for scientists and physicians, because the virus is an elusive one that mutates frequently and, as a result, quickly becomes immune to medication.
  ,
  ,
  A team of , researchers is trying to get one step ahead of the virus with a microbicide they've created that can trick HIV into ""popping"" itself into oblivion.
  ,
  ,
  The microbicide DAVEI - which stands for ""Dual Action Virolytic Entry Inhibitor"" - is the latest in a new generation of HIV treatments that function by specifically destroying the virus without harming healthy cells, researchers said.
  ,
  ,
  ""While several molecules that destroy HIV have recently been announced, DAVEI is unique among them by virtue of its design, specificity and high potency,"" said Dr Cameron Abrams, a professor in Drexel's College of Engineering and a primary investigator of the project.
  ,
  ,
  A team co-led by Abrams and Dr Irwin Chaiken in the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology in Drexel's College of Medicine, and including R V Kalyana Sundaram, developed the chimeric recombinantly engineered protein - that is, a molecule assembled from pieces of other molecules and engineered for a specific purpose, in this case to fight HIV.
  ,
  ,
  HIV invades a healthy cell by first attaching via protein ""spikes"" that then collapse to pull viral and cell membranes together, fusing them and allowing the genetic contents of the virus to enter the healthy cell.
  ,
  ,
  The cell is rewired by the viral genetic material into producing more viruses instead of performing its normal function, which, in the case of cells infected by HIV, involves normal immunity. AIDS is the result.
  ,
  ,
  ""We hypothesised that an important role of the fusion machinery is to open the viral membrane when triggered, and it follows that a trigger didn't necessarily have to be a doomed cell,"" Abrams said.
  ,
  ,
  ""So we envisioned particular ways the components of the viral fusion machinery work and designed a molecule that would trigger it prematurely,"" Abrams said.
  ,
  ,
  The team designed DAVEI from two main ingredients. One piece, called the Membrane Proximal External Region (MPER), is itself a small piece of the fusion machinery and interacts strongly with viral membranes.
  ,
  ,
  The other piece, called cyanovirin, binds to the sugar coating of the protein spike. Working together, the MPER and cyanovirin in DAVEI ""tweak"" the fusion machinery in a way that mimics the forces it feels when attached to a cell.

  The study was published in the journal Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy.

  VARANASI: In order to improve the survival and quality of life of people living with HIV (PLHIV), Banaras Network for Positive People Living (BNPPL) with HIV AIDS Society started a Care and Support Centre, under Vihaan Programme, in consultation with National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) recently. Dr Jaya Chakravarty, Dr Preeti and Dr Archana from Institute of Medical Sciences (IMS), , (BHU) inaugurated the centre at Durgakund area of the city.
  
  ,
  BNPPL HIV AIDS Society is run and managed by HIV positive people themselves and has been helping HIV patients to come to lead a healthy and dignified life for over a decade when there was no ART centre for HIV positive people in Uttar Pradesh.
  ,
  ,
  The CSC will extend support to HIV positive people in 15 different districts.
  ,
  ,
  According to president, BNPPL, Manoj Singh, the main objective of the centre will be to register all the positive people and give counselling to them. It will also be checked that these people are taking regular medicines through ART centres. At the same time, people who have left the treatment will also be connected by carrying out extensive search and will be put on the treatment once again by giving appropriate counselling to them, he informed. According to Dr Jaya Chakravarty from IMS, around 60% of the HIV patients, who are listed under pre-ART at the ART centre of Sir Sundar Lal (SSL) Hospital, Banaras Hindu University (BHU), do not revert back or turn up for the regular check-up. ""The pre-ART person often leave the regular check-up out of social stigma or getting indulged in adverse practices of treatment. Such people are the higher risk factor in the society,"" said Manoj.
  ,
  ,
  The volunteers of BNPPL will fight against cases of discrimination that surface against positive people in the region alongside helping HIV positive people to come out of the stigma and depression.
  ,
  ,
  ""Social stigma and discrimination prevails in the region. Even I was in a terrible shock when I came to know seven years ago that I was HIV positive,"" said Manoj. A 15-member team comprising doctors, social workers, lawyers and others will also be formed to take up the cause of discrimination against HIV patients.

  TRICHY: What makes the life of a , infected person worse is not just the health condition, but the discrimination he or she is forced to face, be it by the family members or the society. But, thanks to the exclusive legal aid centre at ART centre in Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Government Hospital (MGMGH). The centre has so far dealt with 137 cases related to injustice done to patients infected with HIV, who are mostly women.
  
  ,
  Since its inauguration in April 2010, the legal aid centre has so far handled 153 cases including 78 male and 75 female cases related to various types of discrimination against people infected with HIV. Around 137 cases have been solved outside the court. For instance, a 33-year-old man from Palakkarai in ,, who was tested HIV positive after his marriage to a 24-year-old woman in Pudukkottai, died in January 2012. Since her husband succumbed to HIV, the family of her husband harassed her in order to chase her away from them.
  ,
  ,
  Moreover, they denied her a share in their property. The woman was brought to the legal aid centre a few months after her husband's death. The advocate and the counsellor counselled the family members of her husband and explained them about the legal consequences they would face if she was denied of her rights. Only then his family agreed to give her share. Initially they disagreed to give her the share as they were under the impression that their son was infected with HIV because of his wife. But the fact was that she was infected with HIV by her husband. ""We are successfully dealing with the case and trying to get justice. The HIV affected people can approach the legal aid centre for solving their problems. The legal aid centre functions on Tuesday and Friday,"" said advocate ,, who has been dealing with such cases for the past two years.
  ,
  ,
  In some cases, the family of the husband is withholding the dowry given to the woman. Likewise, many people don't return the money borrowed from the HIV affected person after the death. Such cases have also been dealt.
  ,
  ,
  ""The families of the husband try to seize the property that should be given to his wife. I have come across some patients who were even denied to use the ration card by the family of her husband. The women, who are already upset after being infected by her husband, can not think of approaching the court. The legal aid centre in the ART centre is a boon for such people as it helps them to get their legal issues solved,"" A Thamil, network for positive people in Trichy, told TOI.

"Updated: Sep 27, 2013, 07:12 IST",Antifungal foot cream may help eradicate HIV,"

  WASHINGTON: In a breakthrough, scientists have discovered that a common drug used to treat nail fungus in feet may permanently eradicate the deadly , from the body. The topical anti-fungal drug , causes HIV infected cells to commit suicide by jamming up the cells' powerhouse — the ,, researchers said.
  
  ,
  Unlike current anti-HIV drugs, Ciclopirox completely eradicates infectious HIV from cell cultures, with no rebound of virus when the drug is stopped, according to researchers at Rutgers New Jersey Medical School. The treatment of patients with HIV has been revolutionized by the advent of combination anti-retroviral drugs.
  ,
  ,
  However, although these drugs are highly effective at keeping HIV at bay, they must be taken for the life of the patient and never eliminate the infection completely . This is illustrated by the often rapid resurgence of virus in patients who stop taking these medications.
  ,
  ,
  The persistence of HIV is partially due to the ability of the virus to disable the cell's altruistic suicide pathway, which is normally activated when a cell becomes infected or damaged.
  ,
  ,
  A team of researchers led by Michael Mathews and Hartmut Hanauske-Abel, previously showed that Ciclopirox, commonly used by dermatologists and gynaecologists to treat fungal infections, inhibits the expression of HIV genes in culture. The drug works inhibits the expression of HIV genes and also blocks the essential function of the mitochondria, thereby reactivating the cell's suicide pathway.
  ,
  ,
  Healthy, uninfected cells examined during this study were spared. And remarkably, the virus did not bounce back when Ciclopirox was removed, researchers said.
  ,
  ,
  The utility of Ciclopirox in patients with HIV, for instance after topical application to reduce sexual transmission of the virus, awaits verification in future clinical trials.

  WASHINGTON: A new easy-to-use , filled with an anti-retroviral drug could be extremely effective at preventing the deadly HIV in ,, a new study has found.
  
  ,
  The ring is easy to use, long-lasting, and recently has demonstrated a 100 per cent success rate protecting primates from the simian immunodeficiency virus (SHIV).
  ,
  ,
  The device will soon undergo its first test in humans, researchers said.
  ,
  ,
  ""After 10 years of work, we have created an intra-vaginal ring that can prevent against multiple HIV exposures over an extended period of time, with consistent prevention levels throughout the menstrual cycle,"" said Patrick Kiser, an expert in intra-vaginal drug delivery.
  ,
  ,
  Previous studies have demonstrated that antiviral drugs can prevent HIV infection, but existing methods for delivering the drug fall short.
  ,
  ,
  Pills must be taken daily and require high doses; vaginal gels that must be applied prior to each sex act are inconvenient, yielding poor usage rates.
  ,
  ,
  The new ring is easily inserted and stays in place for 30 days. Moreover, because it is delivered at the site of transmission, the ring — known as a TDF-IVR (tenofovir disoproxil fumarate intravaginal ring) — utilizes a smaller dose than pills.
  ,
  ,
  The device contains powdered tenofovir, an anti-retroviral drug that is taken orally by 3.5 million HIV-infected people worldwide, but that has not previously been studied topically, researchers said.
  ,
  ,
  The ring's strength stems from its unique polymer construction: its elastomer swells in the presence of fluid, delivering up to 1,000 times more of the drug than current intra-vaginal ring technology, such as NuvaRing, which are made of silicon and have release rates that decline over time.
  ,
  ,
  The upcoming clinical trial, to be conducted in November at , College of Medicine in New York, will evaluate the ring in 60 women over 14 days.
  ,
  ,
  The trial will assess the ring's safety and measure how much of the drug is released and the properties of the ring after use.
  ,
  ,
  Other drugs could potentially be integrated into the ring, such as contraceptives or antiviral drugs to prevent other sexually transmitted infections — a feature that could increase user rates, said Kiser, who joined , from the ,, where the research was conducted.

  The study was published in the journal Proceedings of , Academy of Sciences (PNAS).

  It was not clear how she contracted the disease as her parents tested negative for the infection. What baffled the doctors more was that the donor, whose blood was picked from a local private blood bank and transfused to the girl, also tested negative.

  ,
  Suspecting that the doctors of the private hospital tampered with the records, the parents lodged a complaint with the local police against the doctors and the blood bank organisers. With private doctors hitting streets against the police case and harassment, district collector , ordered a thorough probe into the incident.

  ,
  A medical team headed by the head of pediatric wing at GGH, district medical health officer (DMHO) and two other experts conducted an in-depth investigation into the incident by sending the blood samples of the baby and her parents to a private lab in Chennai for PCR test.

  ,
  The issue was further complicated when the PCR test confirmed that the child was positive for HIV and the parents negative.

  The unfazed private doctors under the aegis of IMA raised suspicion whether the couple was the biological parents of the child. They alleged that the couple might have adopted the girl and demanded further probe.

  There are about 1,700 inmates in the central prison. In the last six months alone, 12 new HIV positive inmates have been identified. Sources from the , (TANSACS) allege that lack of cooperation and interest among the higher officials of the society and central prison has been hindering treatment for the inmates. Treatment for the newly-detected cases in the last six months could not be started due to this.

  ""As many as six inmates were found with HIV infection in April this year alone after undergoing the mandatory tests for new inmates of the prison. In May, no case was detected. However, six cases were detected between June and September. Since homosexual activity is rampant in the prison the inmates have high risk of getting infection. Detecting the HIV patients and providing required treatment for them is indispensable,"" said sources from the TANSACS.

  Doctors say that testing the HIV patients at regular intervals is absolutely necessary. They should be brought to the anti-retroviral treatment (ART) on the premises of the , for treatment. They would be provided with medicines and kept in observation to analyse the patients' reaction to the medicine.
  ,
  ,
  Sources from TANSACS said that they could not provide treatment for the HIV inmates since they are not brought to ART centres by the prison authorities. Citing inadequate police strength to escort the inmates to the centre, the officers refuse to send them for treatment. As a consequence, the inmates are deprived of proper treatment ending up in getting only regular tablets, they said. Moreover, TANSACS officials could not follow the HIV positive inmates when they are released on bail since majority of the prisoners' address available with the prison are found to be fake, the sources added.

  PANAJI: Concentrated efforts over the period of a decade to minimize the , of HIV are now showing results.
  ,
  ,
  The rate of positivity oscillated between 10-13% from 1996 to 2001 but came down to 1.7% in 2012. The decrease in HIV cases has been significant since 2008, in which year the rate of positivity dropped to 6.10% and in the subsequent year it dropped to 4.25%.
  ,
  ,
  As per the last count, in April 2013, 168 new cases were detected as against 1,000-900 new cases registered every year about a decade ago. Dr Sachin Govenkar, project director, Goa State Aids Control society (GSACs), said better surveillance, awareness programmes and interventions, have helped curb HIV in the state.
  ,
  ,
  The drop in number of HIV cases is significant because the number of blood samples tested during the last five years is far higher than between 2003 and 2008. Since 2009 onwards, the number of blood samples tested crossed the 30,000-mark, whereas during the preceding years' blood samples tested varied between 14,000 and 25,000 a year.

  Officials of the , (Tansacs) fume over the unnecessary delay in announcing the HIV test results, which make them to run from pillar to post in search of the patients who test positive. They say that every month around 10 to 15 HIV positive patients tested at the VCTC could not be traced from a total of around 45 positive cases.
  ,
  ,
  Although the time needed for the preliminary test is only a couple of minutes, it takes one day's time to announce the results due to the absence of a CMO, who is the authority to approve the test result. Sources from Tansacs say that an estimated 120 HIV positive cases go untraced every year due to this delay. They do not return the next day to receive the results mainly due to fear. If the results are furnished instantly they can be counselled and treated, they add since the anti-retroviral therapy centre to treat the patients is available inside the same building.

  CHENNAI: , for people with AIDS and HIV may soon become a reality. The , regulator has issued draft guidelines seeking views and comments from insurers on issuing life cover policies to persons with ,.
  
  ,
  The draft circular by the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (,) on policies for people with HIV/AIDS, issued this month, may come into effect from April 2014. Insurers are expected to put in place a board-approved underwriting manual, claims manual, proposal form and other necessary systems before this date.
  ,
  ,
  A vast majority of those afflicted in India are in the age bracket of 15 to 49 years. As per estimates, about 2.4 million Indians are living with HIV/AIDS. Children less than 15 years account for 3.5% of it while 83% are in the age group of 15-49 years.
  ,
  ,
  Health cover for people suffering from HIV/AIDS already exists. With advances in medical treatment, insurers are able to put in place cost structures. Some standalone health insurance providers like Star Health & Allied Insurance offer such insurance. ""We offer group covers to NGOs for their members. Our policy prescribes the entry parameters,"" V Jagannathan, chairman, Star Health said.
  ,
  ,
  Insurers say claims management and profitability will be key concerns when life insurance is offered to those with AIDS. There would be additional costs. ""In terms of product pricing, insurers mostly rely on past claims experience. Since this would be a new product altogether, the pricing could be at both ends of the spectrum. Insurers may start at the lower range, get claims and then revise premiums upwards. They may also err on the side of caution with higher rates in the beginning and as more players come into the market, the rates would become more competitive,"" Rahul Aggarwal, CEO of Optima Insurance Brokers, said.
  ,
  ,
  ""The premium loadings would also depend on the age of the person and stage of the condition,"" Vikas Gujral, executive vice-president and head, customer service and operations, Max Life Insurance said.
  ,
  ,
  Some companies are looking at dual cover—health in addition to life—to ensure better claim control. ""We may insist on a health cover before issuing a life cover for this segment because in case of AIDS/HIV, the patient has lower immunity than , of the population. So, he/she is susceptible to other illnesses as well,"" a life insurer said.
  ,
  ,
  Industry observers say that due to the nature of the condition, insurers would also have to contend with a huge claims outgo. ""Chances are high that the insured may use up the sum insured every year and once a policy is issued, it cannot be withdrawn,"" Aggarwal said.
  ,
  ,
  Insurers are also playing it safe. Companies like Max and HDFC have already started talks with global reinsurers to participate in this scheme. ""This is a fairly complex product and we are taking inputs from reinsurers as they have global exposure on this front,"" Sanjay Tiwari, vice-president, products, , said.

If that too fails, then it is a death sentence because third line of treatment is not available. The immune system of the body stops functioning.""

Under the project, 13 members of the club have taken ahead National Aids Control Organization (NACO)-funded group to promote and sell their final products. The self-help unit, which had received a bank loan of Rs 10 lakh through NACO, was unable to find any buyers for the bags they were making, after an initial phase of sales. ""Although the loan helped the women import sewing and printing machines from Germany and produce semi-cloth bags of high quality, they had not been able to bag any orders for over four months. Even as the bags are competitive enough to hold a stand in the market, the women hardly have any market knowledge. This worked to their disadvantage and they couldn't generate any sales,"" said UICET student Aman Arora. He believed that the bio-degradability of the bags will add to their USP, given that plastic bags have been banned in the market. ""These bags decompose in six months and are quite affordable, costing between Rs 160 and Rs 300 per kilogram,"" Arora added.
  ,
  ,
  After the students stepped in, the scenario of the unit has changed for the better. On the verge of being shut down in the absence of any orders, the UICET students helped the unit increase its market, outreach as well as profits. The team members went to shops in malls and other markets of Chandigarh for negotiating orders for the bags. ""There was some problem with the screen they used for printing the bags. After it was changed and samples were shown to stores, the response was good. We helped them get orders from shops in leading malls and different markets of the city,"" said UICET's Enactus president Saurabh Mittal.

  Ahead of World AIDS day on December 1, , infected people from different parts of the city congregated at Government General Hospital on Friday to narrate their ordeal and their fight with a disease which was once considered a killer.

  The people stood in stark contrast to the images usually portrayed of the HIV infected. ""I am perfectly normal. I don't see myself as a patient any more,"" said 60-year-old Murugesh*, a caterer, who was diagnosed as HIV positive two decades ago. Like every other HIV infected person, the father of two thought he was as good as dead when he tested positive. ""When I saw my wife and children, I re-discovered my will to live. I decided to fight against it till my last breath, and here I am two decades later,"" smiled Murugesh.

  While Murugesh found his strength in his family, Hema* knew it would be the end of the road for her only son if she succumbed to the virus. ""My son was just four when my husband and I were infected. We had married against our families' wishes. We knew he would have no one if we died,"" said the 42-year-old, who was infected in 2001. ""My husband died in 2004. My resolve to live only grew stronger after that. I did odd jobs to fund my son's education. Many people turned me away when they got to know I had AIDS,"" said Hema, who had a near death experience in 2006.

  The gathered people rued that despite awareness campaigns by the government, HIV infected and affected people have a tough time getting a job. ""It is sad that they are still identified as patients who have a dreaded disease. While many are waking up to the fact that HIV can't be transmitted through sharing a glass, the awareness hasn't gone to the extent of employing infected people.

  ""The positive cases have come down drastically by more than half from 2007 numbers. If the positive cases were about 1,245 in 2007 about 90 cases being reported per month, including pregnant women, now the cases are averaging less 50 per month,"" said Dr Kishore Kumar M, District , officer.

  He pointed out that while in 2007, the test to positive ration was 16% in 2013 it has come to as low as 1.45%. Delineating the statistics, he said, ""In 2007 of the 7,986 persons tested 1,245 were tested positive, in 2013 (till October end) of the 38,985 tested only 567 were positive cases. Last year, as many as 38,294 went in for testing and there were 867 cases. This year, we expect the test number to reach 44,000,"" he said.
  ,
  ,
  Dr Kishore said the positive development was that every year from 2007 the cases were coming down by more than 100, hoping to achieve better progress in next couple of years.
  ,
  ,
  The most heartening fact is the effective control of transmission of HIV from an HIV-positive mother to her child during pregnancy. Nearly five per cent of infections are attributable to parent-to-child-transmission. Dr Kishore pointed out that froma high of 82 cases in 2007 among 14,764 pregnant women tested, the numbers had come down to 23 in 2012 among 23,575 tested. This year till October 21 cases have been reported among 22,141 tested.

  Among the cases reported this year till October, Mangalore taluk has the highest number at 214, followed by Bantwal (51), Belthangady (45), Puttur 927) and Sullia taluk reported 15 cases. The rest of the 215 cases are from other districts tested here.

  ,
  ,
  As of now, from 2006 till date 2,492 persons are being administered ART (Anti-Retroviral Treatment). Dr Kishore said HIV management suggests that antiretroviral therapy should be recommended to those with HIV whose CD4 cell counts are below 350 cells/mm3. Earlier the threshold was 250. Antiretroviral treatment boosts the immune system and reduces the risks of HIV-related death and disease. It also lowers the risk of co-infection like tuberculosis.

Richa is just 18 and had been diagnosed with HIV positive. And like Richa, several youngsters in their adolescence had been diagnosed with HIV in the last one and a half years.
  
  ,
  According to the data available with the , (ART) Centre in civil hospital, about 500 patients aged 15 and 24 years, under the category of adolescents, have been admitted since the last one-and-a-half years.

  According to the present report, there are 3,700 patients being treated at the ART centre in Ludhiana, out of which 500 are adolescents between the age group of 15 and 24.

  Two major hospitals- , and Christian Medical College and Hospital in the city also report their HIV positive cases to the ART centre.
  ,

  These numbers have varied during the last four year since the ART centre was launched on December 17, 2009. Initially, the ART centre used to receive about 10-20 cases of adolescents over the years. But now the figures have increased and the centre currently treats 500 registered cases.

  Talking about the tremendously increasing figures of HIV positive among the adolescents in last four years in city centre, Gurjit Singh, SMO, ART centre, said, ""At present, around 500 cases of HIV positive in adolescents are being treated here.

  ,
  According to experts, an overview of the data reveals that out of the 3,700 HIV cases being treated, 87% are cases of sexual infection, 5-10% of drug abuse, and others due to infection from mother to child and blood transfusion. In case of adolescents, 70% cases happen due to sexual activity and rest due to drug abuse.
  ,
  ,
  Vikas Garg, assistant professor medicine from Dayanand Medical College and Hospital, said, ""We receive about 10-20 HIV patients every month, of which adolescents make up for the major number of confirmed cases. The reason behind the increase in these cases is that even after widespread awareness about ,, people do not take it seriously. Drug abuse as the major reason in city had been spreading fast among the adolescents. They mainly get affected by sharing the used syringes, which many a times may be infected. And as the infected person is more prone to opportunistic infections, it leads to other diseases.""

  Talking about the root cause of cases, Navjot Singh, professor and unit head department of medicine, CMC, said, ""There is only one way to cure this problem, which is by starting treatment as soon as it is diagnosed. Although, an HIV positive person is mostly left with little time, proper and timely treatment can help improve many cases.""

  The vows that Jyoti Dhawale and Vivek Surve exchanged on October 13 this year, with the blessings of lord Ram, Sita, Jagannath, Balram and Subhadra, weren't just the usual that Hindu , do.
  ,

  Surve, art director at a leading publishing house, pledged to support Dhawale, 38, in her fight to lift the stigma off AIDS, and gradually tweak the mindset of those around them by being a model 'mixed status' couple.
  ,
  ,
  And that's not the only stereotype they are crashing.
  ,
  ,
  Dhawale is no emaciated, drawn HIV victim. She fills up the room when she hurries in. ""I can't hear,"" she says, motioning to her hearing aid. Her eardrums were damaged in a car accident when she was three.
  ,
  ,
  But her hardest struggle has been to fight the stigma that came with the HIV virus she contracted eight years ago due to medical negligence.
  ,
  ,
  The three abortions she underwent between 2004 and 2006 (""Oral contraceptive made me nauseous and my ex-husband didn't care for condoms"") did her in. The homemaker, blogger and HIV activist believes infected surgical implements may have been used. ""Poz? Me? Not possible. There has to be a mistake,"" she writes on her blog, recounting receiving the test results when she went in for her fourth abortion. That she had destroyed records of all three previous surgeries meant she couldn't hold anyone accountable. ""The nursing home staff suggested I have the baby because it was my last chance due to the complications the serial abortions had led to.""
  ,
  ,
  Until then, Dhawale admits, she knew nothing about the Human Immunodeficiency Virus which triggers the progressive failure of the immune system, allowing life-threatening infections to thrive. ""I thought it only happened to those with multiple partners. I didn't have them, neither did my husband."" The Vasai , she delivered her baby at (he is seven years old now), administered Zidovudine, an antiretroviral drug, to prevent transmission of virus from mother to child. Her marriage ended in 2007 — ""due to incompatibility, not the infection"", she clarifies — making her isolation complete. The counselling centre run by Kripa Foundation that she was directed to was ill equipped to empower patients with accurate information about medicine dosage, side effects or the nature of the virus.
  ,
  ,
  She realised she had to know more. The online information space was one she chose to dip into between 2010 and 2011, sparking off her transformation. Dhawale learnt that virus transmission didn't stand a chance if partners stayed healthy and the infected person kept the virus count low with medication.
  ,
  ,
  ""In India, abstinence is the only solution experts offer,"" she says, recounting how an 'AIDS specialist' she visited in 2012 advised Surve, who was then her boyfriend, against kissing her. ""He even suggested we wear gloves while being intimate. Even if traces of the virus exist in the ,, it cannot be transmitted unless one or both partners have bleeding gums or open sores. It's the same during oral sex unless one partner suffers from an STD or the viral load is at a detectable level,"" she clarifies.
  ,
  ,
  In fact, it was during her time online that she met Surve. The two hit it off, and eventually she told him she was HIV+ve. ""He disappeared for three months,"" she giggles.
  ,
  ,
  ""I was shocked,"" he says. ""But not a single day went by when I did not think of her.""
  ,
  ,
  Surve, who Dhawale says on her blog, had dilly dallied for two-anda-half years, offered a commitment this August when she was ironically preparing to participate at an HIV matrimonial meet in Pune. Expectedly, there was resistance from Surve's family. After all, she had a 'sex worker's' disease. ""We tell people on a need-to-know basis, and educate them on how it's transmitted,"" says Surve, who admits that it's family and close friends who are aware that they are a serodiscordent couple.
  ,
  ,
  That Dhawale never let the virus , her vivacity has made sure the couple enjoy a ""rocking, fearless but protected sex life"". ""There are procedures to follow in case of a , tear, pills you can take within 72 hours of the act, under the doctor's guidance,"" explains Surve.
  ,
  ,
  Their constant effort is to keep the virus load down, reducing any chance of transmission. The medicines that Dhawale takes twice a day at times so precise, the couple set an alarm for it, are personalised based on her lifestyle, and blood, liver parameters. ""If you miss a dose, the virus will multiply. If you overdose, the hormones go for a toss,"" he says.
  ,

  Does the fear of untimely death hang over the couple? ""With proper exercise, diet and medication,"" he says, ""an HIV+ve person can outlive an HIV-ve one. We are making sure Jyoti does.""

  MUMBAI: The country may have achieved a dramatic 57% drop in , cases, including deaths, but a study on lives lost to , shows that the government is still light years away from its 'Getting-to-Zero' target.
  
  ,
  'Getting to Zero' implies total deletion of new infections, deaths, stigma and discrimination, and the 2015 deadline is not too far away. A recent mortality investigation carried out by semi-government entity Institute of Actuaries of India on people living with HIV (PLHIV) shows among the deceased, the illiterate population make for the higher number, unprotected sex is still the commonest reason behind the transmission of HIV, those between 25 and 49 years of age bear 83% of the death burden and there is a significant time gap between a person getting infected and him/her seeking treatment. The study investigated 1,695 deaths between April 2012 and March 2013 in 20 ART centres of five districts, representative of the whole country.
  ,
  ,
  The study, carried out with support from , Aids Control Organisation (NACO), is supposed to act as a guide for insurers to design the , cover for PLHIV and price the risks accordingly. In its report, the IAI has suggested that CD4 count at the time of registering for ART, access to regular treatments and educational, economical and social backwardness were among major factors for longevity of life. It has recommended stricter data development and maintenance to ,.
  ,
  ,
  The survey report underlines how the uneducated population contributes to 44% of the deaths, even though the rate of infection among them is only about 27%. Education, say experts, clearly has a defining role to play in HIV care but how and why is subject to further exploration. The report says the average time lost before a patient approaches a free anti-retroviral centre is about 7.4 months. ""A delay in starting treatment could lead to faster deterioration of a patients' health and s/he may also fall prey to opportunistic infections, like TB,"" said a volunteer with one of the city's 69 Integrated Testing and Counselling Centres.
  ,
  ,
  Most worryingly, the study revealed that in 90% of the deaths, the infection was transmitted through unprotected sex. A NACO official told TOI that despite the exponential success rate of condom use, unprotected sex remained a nagging worry. In Mumbai too, it is a challenge to check the transmission of the virus among high-risk groups such as men having sex with men (MSM). ""Over the last five years, MSM in Mimbai has witnessed a drop of 88% in HIV transmission. But still, the infection rate among the high-risk group in the city is much higher than the national figure,"" said Dr Balkrishna Adsul, additional project director, Mumbai District Aids Control Society.

  HYDERABAD: Barely a week after the ,, experts said a very rare form of , in the city is taking the medical fraternity and researchers here by surprise.
  
  ,
  The HIV-2 strain, is common in west African countries like Senegal, Sierra Leone, Ghana and is rarely found outside the African continent. The ,, is considered more vicious compared to the HIV-1 virus.
  ,
  ,
  In the last six months alone, about 67 samples sent to , (IPM) by the APSACS (,) have tested positive. Furthermore, dozens of samples are currently awaiting confirmation for the presence of the virus. The IPM uses the more accurate western blot method for detection of the virus.
  ,
  ,
  Even private hospitals are getting cases of patients affected with the virus. ""It is a fact that few even in the medical profession are not adequately informed about the HIV-2 virus,"" said Sunita Narreddy from the infection diseases specialty of Apollo Hospitals where about five cases of HIV-2 were recorded this year.
  ,
  ,
  ""Though HIV-1 and HIV-2 belong to the same family, the two differ in terms of their testing methodologies and treatment. Testing is comparatively easier for the HIV-1 virus unlike the HIV-2 virus. Also, there are better treatment options for HIV-1 virus compared to the latter,"" said Narreddy.
  ,
  ,
  Although the method of transmission for both the viruses is same, medicines to treat HIV-1 patients do not work for HIV-2 patients. This explains the fact that there are currently no medicines that the government is prescribing for HIV-2 patients.
  ,
  ,
  ""Medicines for treating HIV-2 virus are still in the testing stages, There are no approved drugs that work for this virus anywhere in the world. Hence, we cannot risk a patient's life by administering any drugs at this point of time,"" said a government official of the state health department.

  In India, there have been a few cases of HIV-2 being reported from some pockets in and around Mumbai.

  VISAKHAPATNAM: In 1988, when the first , on the theme 'Youth & AIDS' was observed, the disease was synonymous with death. Since then, India and the world have come a long way. This year, the day was observed on the theme 'Getting to Zero,' i.e., zero new infections, zero discrimination and zero deaths.

  Speaking on the occasion on Sunday, renowned general physician Dr Kutikuppala Surya Rao, a specialist in the treatment of ,, gave an insight into the latest advancements in the treatment of the disease. ""In 1987, the first HIV drug Zidovidene came into market. In 2000, HIV was transformed as a chronic manageable disease. In 2010, there was a breakthrough when HIV positive , patient , turned HIV negative after stem cell therapy. Now, the focus of the world is on HIV cure. Safe sex, safe needle, safe blood, safe motherhood and respect for culture would prevent HIV/AIDS.""
  ,
  ,
  However, challenges still persist.
  ,
  ,
  ""In 2012, vaccine trial on monkeys to clear HIV from blood showed promise but is yet to be tested on human. HAART (Highly active anti-retroviral therapy), can help achieve a near-normal life and zero viremia (less than 50 viral copies per ml in the blood) is possible today. But unfortunately, the HIV in the body is in the latent stage, so the HAART is not able to reach the latent virus. Unless the drug comes to attack the latent virus, the HIV problem would persist. Studies on valopuric acid (to kill the latent virus) are inconclusive.

  VISAKHAPATNAM: A dermatologist who runs a private , in Kakinada reveals that at least 10% of the , he treats comprise doctors and medical staff who have contracted the deadly virus while working in government hospitals. ""The number is quite alarming. But there's no way to prove that the virus has been transmitted through patients during surgeries or treatment even though the risk of contracting HIV is very high in government hospitals. Also, due to the stigma involved, the actual statistics never come out,"" the doctor informs.
  
  ,
  While private hospital doctors can choose to turn away patients who refuse to undergo HIV test prior to surgeries, there's no such option for doctors working in government hospitals. Legally, a patient can't be forced to undergo the HIV test. For operating on such patients, the medical team needs special protective and disposable gear, which may or may not be available always at state-run hospitals, exposing doctors and others in the operation theatre to the risk of contracting the deadly HIV virus. Taking elaborate safety precautions for all surgical cases is also not economically feasible, point out medical experts.
  ,
  ,
  Dr P V Sudhakar, head of the department of plastic surgery and deputy superintendent of King George Hospital (KGH), informs, ""Unlike private hospitals, we can't turn away a vulnerable patient who refuses to undertake HIV test prior to a surgery. So the entire surgical team needs to be alerted about the HIV status of the patient and accordingly, the doctors, medicos and other healthcare personnel associated with the surgery need to take special precautions, wear disposable synthetic gowns and double gloves but often government hospitals run out of special gears and HIV kits. Taking universal precautions for each and every case, assuming all of them to be HIV positive or , positive cases, may not be economically feasible.""
  ,
  ,
  The lack of gloves sometimes forces junior doctors or medicos to draw blood samples barehanded, a situation that clearly is alarming for them. Says a junior doctor from the hospital, ""After drawing blood samples barehanded due to the shortage of gloves, we do rush to take post-exposure prophylaxis. But this too is not recommended nor possible every time as these could be toxic drugs. There needs to be continuous supply of special gears and kits for dealing with HIV patients. The only other option for us is to purchase the disposable gloves from our pocket each time we assist in surgeries or draw blood.""
  ,
  ,
  When queried, Dr Jayachandra Reddy, joint director, basic services, , (APSACS) remarked, ""Indiscriminate HIV testing is not required prior to surgery for all patients. Naco (,) has already prescribed testing for all pregnant women. Besides, high risk vulnerable groups and TB symptomatic patients should be tested for HIV before operations. Instead, doctors should rather opt for universal safety precautions while undertaking every surgery to curtail the risk of transmission.""

  ""Since the new regimen will come into practice soon, we wanted our members to know about the changes in treatment modalities,"" said IMA, Nagpur president Dr Warsha Dhawale. Explaining the new regimen and the reason for introducing it, Dr Kedar who is also the chairperson of IMA's HIV committee said, ""For preventing the transmission of virus from mother to child, we give the mother only one drug. Resistance has developed against this drug in the virus, so we will start administering three drugs to pregnant positive women.""
  ,
  ,
  Primary prevention measure must be to avoid unwanted pregnancy and monitor a planned one in an HIV positive woman, said Dr Kulkarni. ""Once infected, it is important to link them to proper care and treatment. The new programme seems much more efficient than the previous one. Its success, however, would depend on the extent of patients covered. The most important thing is to screen all pregnant women for HIV and link all patients to proper facilities,"" he said.
  ,
  ,
  Along with this, stress must be given on adolescent counselling to prevent new cases of the disease as India is among the top 12 countries as far as load of HIV-positive adolescents are concerned, said Dr Kedar. Agreed Dr Bhurshundi and added, ""Though the prevalence of HIV is decreasing, there is another alarming trend to be concerned about. Most people affected by the disease are in the 18-24 age group and yet there is not much research or stress on these patients.""

  NEW DELHI: A new report puts India among 12 high burden countries like South Africa, Nigeria and Tanzania that are home to the 2.1 million adolescents living with , in 2012. A , says that AIDS-related deaths amongst adolescents between the ages of 10 and 19 increased by 50% between 2005 and 2012, rising from 71,000 to 110,000 and that many adolescents were unaware that they were infected.
  
  ,
  The 2013 Stocktaking Report on Children and AIDS—released on the occasion of World AIDS on Sunday-- says that an estimated 74% of the 2.1 million adolescents live in 12 high burden countries. It says that investments to the tune of USD 5.5 billion by next year will be required to avoid an added two million adolescents, particularly girls, becoming infected by 2020. Investments in 2010 were US$3.8 billion.
  ,
  ,
  ""If high-impact interventions are scaled up using an integrated approach, we can halve the number of new infections among adolescents by 2020,"" said , Executive Director Anthony Lake. ""It's a matter of reaching the most vulnerable adolescents with effective programmes - urgently.""
  ,
  ,
  The report also found that girls are more vulnerable among adolescents. Of the total of 2.1 million individuals, 1.2 million are females. The total infected adolescent population in South Asia is 130,000 with 51% men and 49% women. Much more attention is needed to prevent and treat HIV during adolescence, so that children remain AIDS-free in the second decade of life. New infections among adolescents could be halved by 2020 by scaling up high-impact interventions and working across sectors. The treatment, care and support needs of children living with HIV change as they grow older and begin to take greater responsibility for their own health. But services generally do not keep pace with or cater to their needs. This is particularly true for marginalized adolescents males who have sex with males, adolescents who inject drugs and sexually exploited adolescents despite the disproportionately high prevalence of HIV among them.
  ,
  ,
  Experts have advised a combination of high-impact interventions including condoms, antiretroviral treatment, prevention of mother-to-child transmission, voluntary medical male circumcision, communications for behaviour change, and targeted approaches for at-risk and marginalized populations. This is in addition to investments in other sectors such as education, social protection and welfare, and strengthening health systems.

Right after birth, Nevirapine and Septran syrup are given to the baby. Blood tests (DBS-PCR tests) are also done from time to time till the child is one-and-half-years old. If the child tests HIV negative, then he or she can be said to be free from HIV transmission. Breastfeeding is also encouraged since the mother is kept on ART drugs.

We are focusing on zero vertical transmission of the virus from the mother to the newborn and therefore implementing PPCT in every possible antenatal case. This advanced drug regime was introduced on September 2012 as a pilot project in AP and Karnataka and now the success rate is almost 98%. We will soon conduct sensitization workshops for private gynaecologists so that PPCT is followed in every case.""

Additional Project director, Dr SK Binjhwar, said there is a need for people with HIV to lead a normal life and contribute to the society, regardless of their infection.

  PUNE: Jails in the state have reported a drop in the number of HIV cases in the last two years. The latest report of the Maharashtra State AIDS Control Society (MSACS) has reported 116 cases of the infection across 30 jails in the state between January and October this year, as against 330 cases that were reported in 2011.
  
  ,
  This year, the highest number of cases was reported from Thane Central Jail, followed by Adharwadi Jail in Kalyan. Fifteen cases were detected in Yerawada Central Jail, the third-highest number of cases. In all, 17 jails reported HIV cases.
  ,
  ,
  ""Of the 15,228 jail inmates who volunteered to get themselves tested for HIV this year, 116 tested positive. Forty five have been put on antiretroviral treatment because of low CD4 count,"" an MSACS official said. The CD4 cells are specialised cells that protect the body. The virus attacks these cells and uses them to spread, which weakens the immune system.
  ,
  ,
  Officials of MSACS said that jail inmates are regularly informed about the causes of spread of HIV and counselled to reduce risks. ""We have trained counsellors who help spread awareness about HIV infection among prisoners and encourage them to get themselves tested. This has resulted in reducing the number of cases over the years,"" said an official of MSACS.
  ,
  ,
  Prisoners contract diseases that are determined both by the environment they come from and also the prison they live in, say experts. If adequate treatment is not given to inmates in jails, they will return to the community further burdening the existing healthcare facilities of the country, say experts.

  ,
  ""The jail inmates are among the most vulnerable population to contract HIV infection due to homosexual relations and through contaminated needles which are used for injecting recreational drugs,"" said senior scientist ,, director of , (NARI).
  ,
  ,
  Experts note that the prison environment, lack of occupation of mind and body and plain boredom lead to accumulated frustration and tension. This environment leads to high-risk activities, such as use of drugs and unprotected sex between men.

"Dec 1, 2013, 01:23 IST",Government hospitals in UP report fewer new cases of HIV,"

  LUCKNOW: New cases of HIV infection reported in government hospitals of Uttar Pradesh show a declining trend. In a gap of just two years, the rate of new HIV infection has reduced by nearly 30-35 % in some of the centres of the state.
  
  ,
  Statistics of Uttar Pradesh State AIDS Control Society show that in 2012 and till January 2013, about 656 new cases of HIV were registered for anti-retroviral therapy at the King George's Medical University while the figure stood at 1,444 in 2010. Likewise, 1,818 new persons were put on anti-retroviral therapy in 2012 and till January 2013 at IMS ,, Varanasi. Not in keeping with this falling trend, however, 3,162 new cases were reported in 2010 for ART at IMS BHU. But, other government centres of the state witnessed a significant fall in new cases of HIV infection.
  ,
  ,
  Not only UP, the similar trend has also been witnessed in the country. The recently released UNAIDS Report 2013 stated that India has managed to reduce new HIV infections by 57% between 2001 and 2012.
  ,
  ,
  Health experts attributed increased public awareness as one of the main reasons behind the fall in number of new HIV cases being reported. ""Due to various educational programmes, people have become more aware about HIV/AIDS. More and more patients in both government and private hospitals insist on use of new needle for injection,"" said A K Tripathi, head of department of clinical haematology.
  ,
  ,
  The other reason is improvement in blood bank services as blood is now checked thoroughly before transfusion. ""The ban on sale of blood has helped a lot,"" said Dr Tripathi. Another major cause is the widespread availability of ART which suppressed the HIV virus and stops the progression of HIV disease. Earlier, ART was available at only a few hospitals of the state but now UP has 22 centres and many district hospitals are linked to centres where HIV persons can get the medicines.
  ,
  ,
  ""Due to ART, the situation has now become better than earlier. There has been decline in rate of new HIV infections and it will reduce more in the coming days,"" said Preetam Kaur, president of Lucknow Positive Women Welfare Society. Kaur added, ""We have come even closer to ensuring that children born to mothers with HIV are delivered without contracting the disease. If a pregnant woman with HIV is getting treatment and delivery at a government hospital, children born to them are negative.""

Adding to his woes, a legislation that promises to punish such discrimination has been in the works for several years now.

  The HIV/AIDS Bill was drafted in 2006, but is being shunted between the health and law ministries. Activists, lawyers and people living with HIV have been fighting for the Bill to be introduced during the winter session of Parliament. Rallies are planned across the country to highlight the issue on Sunday, World AIDS Day. A senior National AIDS Control Organisation official told TOI that the Bill was now with the Cabinet.

  LONDON: , have discovered the world's most aggressive HIV strain. , have reported that a recently discovered , leads to significantly faster development of AIDS than currently prevalent forms.
  
  ,
  There are over 60 different epidemic strains of HIV and geographic regions are often dominated by one or two of these. It has been confirmed earlier that if a person becomes infected with two different strains, they can fuse and a recombined form can occur.
  ,
  ,
  The new strain found to be the most dangerous has been found in ,, ,.
  ,
  ,
  The period from infection to development of AIDS was the shortest reported among HIV-1 types, at around five years.
  ,
  ,
  ""Recombinants seem to be more vigorous and more aggressive than the strains from which they developed. The recombinant studied is called A3/02 and is a cross between the two most common strains in Guinea-Bissau, 02AG and A3,"" said Angelica Palm from Lund University.
  ,
  ,
  So far the new strain has only been identified in West ,, but other studies have shown that the global , of different recombinants is increasing.
  ,
  ,
  ""In countries and regions with high levels of immigration, such as the US and Europe, the trend is towards an increasingly mixed and complex HIV flora, unlike in the beginning of the epidemic when a small number of non-recombinant variants of the virus dominated. There is, therefore, reason to be wary of HIV recombinants in general,"" Palm added.
  ,
  ,
  The virus strain was first reported by Joakim Esbjornsson from the University of Oxford, who is the co-author of the study.
  ,
  ,
  An estimated 4.9 million people were living with HIV in Asia-Pacific in 2012. Twelve countries account for more than 90% of people living with HIV and of new HIV infections in the region which includes India, Cambodia, China, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea, Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam.

  ""HIV is an extremely dynamic and variable virus. New subtypes and recombinant forms of HIV-1 have been introduced to our part of the world, and it is highly likely that there are a large number of circulating recombinants of which we know little or nothing.

"Nov 30, 2013, 02:58 IST",Treatment of HIV-AIDS still poses socio-psychological issues: Study,"

  
  VISAKHAPATNAM: The treatment of the dreaded , may have seen considerable advancements in the last decade thanks to relentless medical research worldwide, but the social stigma and ethical issues revolving around the treatment of HIV-AIDS poses socio-psychological questions, as a recent study by an eminent city-based doctor indicates.
  ,
  ,
  The unique two-year study on 1,800 HIV positive cases in the city found that in almost 75 % of the cases, the patients are not given the right to know about their treatment procedure, informed consent is not taken from 55.1% patients and in nearly 50% cases, principles of confidentiality are not properly maintained, apart from findings related to patient-doctor experiences in treatment of HIV or AIDS.
  ,
  ,
  Claimed to be the first of its kind study internationally, the analytical study titled 'Ethical Challenges Involved in the Care of , Patients and Protecting the rights of the Community,' was undertaken by Padmashree awardee Dr Kutikuppala Surya Rao, who specialises in the treatment of HIV-AIDS.
  ,
  ,
  Though the study was done in the city, the findings more or less hold good for Indian patients in all cities, Dr Surya Rao said. The study was necessitated as several ethical issues and challenges started emerging, especially in terms of the standard of care of HIV/AIDS patients, due to the increasing commercialisation of the medical profession, the doctor stated.
  ,
  ,
  The study sought the opinion of the patients on parameters and ethical issues such as principles of autonomy, paternalism or dictatorship, dignity of individual, informed consent, right to refuse treatment, principles of confidentiality, patient's right to know about his treatment and also role of surrogates (family or relatives).
  ,
  ,
  Of the 1,800 HIV positive patients, 1,450 fully participated in the study between March 2011 and February 2013 and are under treatment at ,, Visakhapatnam. After getting complete responses from 1,450 patients, the study found that 65.6% of the patients faced paternalism or authoritarian behaviour from doctors, 55.2% felt they were not treated in a dignified manner, 75.8% patients faced lack of autonomy, informed consent (that is explaining the pros and cons of treatment and contraindications to patients) was not taken from 55.1% patients, 87.2% patients had no choice to refuse treatment, principle of confidentiality about treatment and HIV status was maintained only in 48.2% cases. Further, just 24.1% of patients said they were informed about their treatment procedures and in 86.2% cases, it's the patients' relatives or guardians who spoke to the doctor on behalf of the patients without giving the patients a chance to speak up about their problems.
  ,
  ,
  ""Overall, it was felt that the , Organisation and , should formulate and implement new ethical guidelines in the treatment and care of HIV/AIDS patients in the background of severe stigma attached to HIV/AIDS,"" stated Dr Rao.
  ,
  ,
  Referring to the key points of the study, professor of psychiatry and superintendent of Government Hospital for ,, Vizag, Dr N N Raju, pointed out that HIV-AIDS is one ailment that is associated with a lot of stigma and different socio-psychological aspects are involved, especially in India. ""Many a time, we come across family members who request the treating doctors not to reveal the HIV status to the patient as they fear the patient would get depressed or turn suicidal if they learn the truth. In such cases, getting informed consent becomes difficult.""
  ,
  ,
  ""Moreover, in India, the doctor-patient ratio is disproportionate and one doctor sometimes has to see around 100 patients a day, which makes giving a patient hearing to each case difficult. More social workers and trained counsellors are required to generate awareness. With effective treatment regime available, HIV, like TB, can be controlled to a great extent and so the stigma needs to be dispelled gradually as has happened in the case of TB in last few decades,"" stated the doctor.

  MUMBAI: In July 2001, four staffers from a non-governmental organization in Lucknow working to fight HIV/AIDS among men who have sex with men (MSM) were arrested and charged with the stringent IPC , (unnatural offences) and for sale obscene material among other offences. They were jailed for 47 days, their HIV/AIDS- related material seized and the offices of their NGOs Naz Foundation and Bharosa Trust sealed.
  
  ,
  Health workers in Chennai, Bangalore and Delhi endured similar harassment, noted , in its publication ""Epidemic of Abuse-Police Harassment of HIV/AIDS outreach workers"". The document highlights a bitter reality of India's battle against HIV/AIDS—fighting the disease becomes an uphill task when criminality is attached to vulnerable communities.
  ,
  ,
  Much of these challenges associated with fighting HIV/AIDS were overcome thanks to the Delhi High Court judgement decriminalising same-sex relations in 2009. But they have been resurrected with the Supreme Court's judgement on Wednesday. Activists fear the judgment will pose a huge setback for HIV/AIDS.
  ,
  ,
  ""It will have a devastating impact on the fight against HIV/AIDS. In the early days it was very hard to get MSMs to health units as they feared police action. This changed only after the Delhi HC judgement,"" says Dr. L Ramakrishnan of Solidarity and Action Against the , Infection in India. He pointed out that the apex court's judgement was likely to give legal backing to the biases of healthcare professionals and could fuel their discriminatory attitudes.
  ,
  ,
  The issue is particularly pressing as MSMs are a high-risk category for HIV/AIDS. Roughly seven per cent of the estimated 25 lakh gay persons in India are HIV-infected, according to the Central government. Their marginalisation in healthcare was in fact the basis of the Public Interest Litigation filed by the Naz Foundation in the Delhi HC.
  ,
  ,
  The National , Control Organization too had admitted in its affidavit that Section 377 acted as a ""serious impediment"" to successful public health interventions. ""Those in the high risk group are mostly reluctant to reveal same-sex behaviour due to fear of law enforcement agencies, keeping a large section invisible and unreachable and thereby pushing the cases of infection underground making it very difficult for public health workers to even access them,"" stated the , affidavit. It had pointed out that social stigma forced many MSMs to deny their behaviour, thereby marrying or having sex with female partners and subsequently putting them too at the risk of HIV/AIDS.
  ,
  ,
  Ashok Row Kavi of the Humsafar Trust too echoed these concerns. ""It will put us in grave trouble. But the NACO's progressive schemes have helped the community and we will continue that work,"" he said.

  * Gay persons would be afraid to approach healthcare systems as they could be reported under Section 377.

  In 2012, 45 babies were born to HIV-positive mothers. However, only one baby tested positive and the rest of them tested negative.
  ,
  ,
  It is unfortunate that in most of the cases the HIV-positive mothers are victims of marriage with HIV-positive men. At the time of marriage, women are not made aware whether their partners are HIV-positive. On the other hand, the men are also lethargic to go for HIV test before marriage. ""When it is found during pregnancy check-up that a woman is HIV-positive, it comes as a shock to them. But many of the uneducated people from rural areas are not bothered about it. At the same time, the educated people from urban areas completely collapse. So, we have to provide counselling to them to give morale booster,"" said Dr Manivannan who appealed to all the married women to undergo HIV test.

  The blood of the new born baby is tested through dry blood sample (DBC) method at the , in Chennai. Normally, the presence of HIV virus can be confirmed only after 18 months of delivery. However, Dr Manivannan said that the results through DBC method would almost be the same as the results that come after 18 months.

  NAGPUR: The , was recently observed, with India gushing over reduction in the number of new cases of HIV/AIDS, patting its back for the commendable health schemes being run for this aim. At the focus of most such programmes is what is coded as ,, or men having sex with men.
  ,
  ,
  Will criminalizing of homosexuality mean that these activities become illegal, too? Will this mean that the National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) would require dropping this huge and vulnerable population group out of their future plans? Such questions are haunting several individuals and organizations working towards , awareness and reduction.
  ,
  ,
  ""For decades, we have worked towards bringing out the hidden population of LGBTQ community to speak about their sexual problems in order to bring down the number of HIV cases amongst them. Now, even if we were to go somewhere to create awareness or discuss a project, it would be likened to encouraging an illegal activity,"" said Kunal Maind, programme manager of NGO Saarthi Trust. This will result in an increase in HIV cases as gay people would fear to come out, which ultimately will be the society's loss, he added.
  ,
  ,
  Questioning the intent and legality of the services and counselling provided to the community by these NGOs is a major worry among them. ""Our field workers are scared that if they go out for any awareness activity, the society will not accept them. Most importantly, they fear for their safety as police or anti-social elements can exploit this situation,"" said Amitgiri Goswami, project manager of GAURAV TI project. In the absence of follow-up of this very vulnerable group of population and awareness among them, there would be an increase in the risk factors, thus taking up the number of people affected by the infection, he feared.
  ,
  ,
  ""Awareness about safe sex has remained limited to the urban areas till now,"" said Vishal Gajbhiye of NGO Aborigine Bahuuddeshiya Sanstha that had taken up a project to spread this awareness to the rural areas in August. ""In the last three months, we have found 4 positive cases out of 55 random check ups we did. None of them knew anything about safe sex options. With this verdict scaring them further, will we ever be able to achieve the 'taking HIV to zero' target,"" he said.

"Dec 12, 2013, 01:25 IST",Gay sex: Body blow to fight against HIV/AIDS,"

  CHENNAI/MUMBAI/DELHI: The ,'s decision to reinstate a colonial-era ban on gay sex is not just a blow to homosexual rights, but also to , medical intervention programmes, say doctors.
  
  ,
  Dr Dilip Mathai, vice president of the AIDS Society of India, said the SC verdict was a setback for medical care for HIV patients who are men who have sex with men (MSMs). ""Our focus is to minimise new cases, but this verdict will make the act more clandestine and prevent doctors from reaching out to gay men who have HIV,"" explained Dr Mathai. He added: ""The homosexual act will not disappear but the community seeking help will reduce drastically. Now while treating male patients, doctors cannot ask, 'Have you indulged in sex with a man,' and this will have a major impact on detecting new cases.""
  ,
  ,
  Dr Kabir Sardana of Delhi's , too said that gay patients suffering from STDs may no longer report their illness for fear of being branded an outlaw.
  ,
  ,
  In one of its report, the Human Rights Watch had highlighted the bitter truth that India's battle against HIV/AIDS was made harder by the criminality attached to vulnerable communities. Some of the challenges underscored were thankfully overcome owing to the Delhi HC ruling in 2009 decriminalising gay sex. But, with the latest SC verdict, the obstacles will get resurrected.
  ,
  ,
  The issue is particularly pressing. MSMs are a high-risk category for HIV/AIDS. About 7% of the estimated 25-lakh gay persons in India are HIV-infected, according to the Central government. Their marginalization in healthcare was in fact the basis of the public interest litigation filed by the Naz Foundation in Delhi HC.
  ,
  ,
  The National AIDS Control Organisation too had conceded in the HC that Section 377 seriously impeded successful public health interventions. ""Those in the high-risk group are reluctant to reveal same-sex behaviour due to the fear of law enforcement agencies, keeping a large section invisible and unreachable and thereby pushing the cases of infection underground, making it very difficult for public health workers to even access them,"" stated the affidavit.
  ,
  ,
  The Human Rights Watch report cited an instance from July 2001, when four NGO staffers in Lucknow working to fight HIV/AIDS among MSMs were arrested and charged under IPC Section 377 (unnatural offences) and for selling obscene material. They were imprisoned for 47 days. Their literature was seized. And the offices of their two NGOs, Naz Foundation and Bharosa Trust, were sealed.
  ,
  ,
  The harassment they suffered has been endured over the years by scores of other health workers in Chennai, Bangalore and Delhi.
  ,
  ,
  ""This (verdict) will have a devastating impact on the fight against HIV/AIDS. In the early days, it was very hard to get MSMs to health units, as they feared police action. This changed only after the Delhi HC judgment,"" said Dr L Ramakrishnan of Solidarity and Action Against the HIV Infection in India. Dr Ramakrishnan said the SC ruling was likely to give legal backing to the biases of some healthcare professionals and fuel their discriminatory attitudes.
  ,
  ,
  The Anti Retroviral Therapy centre in the Government General Hospital in Chennai had seen a rise in gay patients with HIV coming to them for treatment after the Delhi HC verdict in 2009. ""The number MSMs approaching NGOs doubled from 4% to 8%,"" said a senior doctor at the hospital.
  ,
  ,
  Bhavana, programme manager of Sahodaran, a male sexual health project, said: ""If homosexuality is legalised, we can freely distribute condoms to same sex couples. It would have also encouraged people to come out. This verdict will have a negative impact on intervention programmes.""

  GUWAHATI: Containing HIV remains a challenge in the region even though various agencies and the state government have been investing huge sums of money in HIV projects. Lack of awareness and social stigma pose the greatest obstacles in a vulnerable state like Assam.
  
  ,
  Prominent activist ,, the first woman from the northeast to declare herself ,, rued that the social conditions are not conducive to fighting the disease. ""It is very unfortunate that we have failed to create mass awareness regarding HIV. If we continue to be secretive about the disease, we cannot stop it from spreading,"" Goswami, who realized that she was infected with HIV in 1996, told reporters during an interactive session at the Guwahati Press Club, on Saturday.
  ,
  ,
  Even professionals like doctors and health practitioners are not adequately aware, Goswami said, citing examples of how a Guwahati-based private hospital had refused to provide treatment to a 14-year-old boy and his mother because they were HIV positive.
  ,
  ,
  ""It's strange how professional people behave even now. If they continue to spread intolerance, how we can expect the lay man to know about the disease? Several people still shy away from disclosing that they are infected, fearing social stigma. HIV positive people like us have to be vocal if we want to stop this disease from spreading further,"" Jahnabi, who runs the , (ANPP), an NGO to create awareness and to facilitate treatment of HIV positive people, said.
  ,
  ,
  She lauded the proactive role played by the churches in Mizoram in this regard. The scenario is not as encouraging in Assam, with religious and social institutions not showing much interest in spreading awareness about HIV.
  ,
  ,
  According to the ,, the tate currently has an estimated 12,804 HIV positive people, of which 396 are children Though there has been a countrywide decline of 50 per cent in the numbers, she said the infection of young people is a matter of concern.
  ,
  ,
  Jahnabi added that diagnostic or testing centres should target areas in the interior of the state so that the disease can be detected early as it is easier to treat. In the last stage, response to treatment becomes difficult.
  ,
  ,
  Goswami was born in 1976 and was brought up at Kampur village in Nagaon district. At the age of 18, she was married to a Guwahati-based businessman in 1994, without 'checking his antecedents.' In 1995, her husband passed away, leaving behind Jahnabi and their three-month-old daughter, Kastorika.

She does not cry or show any emotions as she narrates her son's painful journey since he was diagnosed with tuberculosis in December 2012. The robust Revised National TB Control Programme was of no consequence to the lower-middle- class family that spent over Rs 4 lakh, collected by selling land and other assets, to fund his treatment in a private hospital.

This January, when his condition deteriorated, the family admitted him to Sewri TB Hospital, where MDR-TB was diagnosed. ""He often complained about the medication and injections,"" said the mother. ""I had no idea about MDR-TB. Doctors don't tell you much. They should have told me the drugs can make one suicidal,"" the mother said.

  Early on Wednesday, the mother said, she gave him his medicines, and left the ward as hospital rules did not allow her to sleep in a male ward. He developed breathing problems around 2am and called his mother on her cell phone. She rushed to his ward immediately. ""The nurse saw me there and started screaming. She said if someone misbehaved with me in a male ward, the hospital will not be responsible. I was asked to leave immediately,"" she said, adding the scuffle happened in front of her son. In less than an hour, the teenager slit his wrist.

""For the next 12 hours, my son lay there waiting for a surgeon to arrive. Three doctors checked his wounds but no one actively treated him. By 6pm, his pulse became feeble.

  GUWAHATI: With only sevenViral Load Test (VLT) centres in the country, and none of them in the northeast, HIV positive people in states like Mizonram, Nagaland, Manipur and Arunachal Pradesh expressed concern over the difficulty of accessing VLTs. They demanded that the department of AIDS control (DAC) increase VLT availability. The test is crucial to detecting the onset of AIDS.
  
  ,
  Networks affiliated to People Living with HIV (PLHIV) like the Manipur-based Community Network for Empowerment (Cone), a state-level network of people who use drugs, and Medicine Sans Frontiers (MSF) stated that the Manipur State AIDS Clinical Expert Panel (SACEP) is not doing enough to ensure availability of VLT. It also accused SACEP of falling prey to bureaucratic red tape and putting the lives of HIV positive people at risk.

  ,
  ""In Assam and Sikkim, samples are sent directly to the referral laboratory in Kolkata. However, HIV positive people in Nagaland, Mizoram and Arunachal Pradesh have to come to the , in Imphal to give their blood samples. They have to wait a long time to get their results as well,"" said Leena Menghaney, campaign coordinator, MSF.
  ,
  ,
  According to recent guidelines of , (WHO), HIV positive people who are on antiretroviral treatment(ART) need to get a VLT done annually to ensure correct treatment.
  ,
  ,
  Menghaney added that VLT accessibility in some African countries was better than in India. Citing an example of an HIV positive Manipuri girl who lost her life while waiting for a VLT, community members of PLHIV expressed that treatment monitoring was a necessity.
  ,
  ,
  ""HIV positive people in the region, whose first line of treatment had failed, could die waiting for access to VLT to confirm treatment failure. We want DAC to respond to the situation here and ensure that patients do not face unnecessary delays in their clinical assessment,"" said Rakjumar Nalinkanta, president, CONE.
  ,
  ,
  Till July 2013, Mizoram had 8,258 HIV positive people, with 2,556 patients on ART, 12 patients on second line treatment, and 14 people waiting for VLT. Two people died last year in December while waiting for VLT. In Manipur, there are more than 40,000 HIV positive people. VLT determines the success of ART. There are VLT machines in Manipur, Assam and Megahalya but they are not recognized by NACO.

  Viral Load Test measures the number of copies of HIV'S genetic material (RNA) in every millilitre of blood. A person's viral load is undetectable when there are less than 50 copies per millilitre of blood, implying that the virus has been suppressed.

  The test prevents patients from being given more expensive drugs by doctors. However, owing to its high price of VRL, a patient's CD4 white blood cells are still used to monitor a patient's response to treatment.

  ""HIV cases should be screened for other viruses and a holistic treatment given to patients for a better quality life,"" he said while delivering the eighth Professor JV Bhat Memorial Oration at School of Life Sciences, Manipal University here on Monday.
  ,
  ,
  ""Since most of the HIV-related mortality is due to these liver infections, and not necessarily from that of HIV, the experts should pay attention to the viruses as there is sufficient evidence to show they exist. All viruses should be taken into consideration together and treated appropriately. Because if HIV is treated and contained, the hepatitis viruses' problem still remains,"" said Professor Thyagarajan and added by doing so, the mortality rate can be reduced.

  He spoke on the co-infection of HIV and the various forms of Hepatitis Virus (HBV, HCV etc.) in Indian population. A pioneer in this area of research, he gave an overview of the different facets of the HIV-HBV and HIV-HCV co-infections.
  ,
  ,
  Backed by scientific data, he showed that co-infection of HIV-HCV was much more prevalent in the population than that of HIV-HBV co-infection.
  ,
  ,
  He also pointed out that with advances in anti-retroviral therapy (ART) death due to HIV infections has been on the wane. However, most of the deaths that still occur are due to secondary or co-infections with liver diseases due to hepatitis virus co-infection being the most common cause. These can, with the help of available prognostic markers and treatment modalities, be altered with interactions between the clinicians and the diagnostic microbiologists.

  IMPHAL: Highlighting the plight of People Living with HIV and AIDS (PLHIVs) in the state, various NGOs submitted a joint memorandum to chief minister Okram Ibobi Singh on Saturday, after a meeting between representatives of Women Action for Development, Christian Network for Positive Women, Platform for Positive Women, Self Support Group, World Vision, CoNE and FXB was convened here.
  
  ,
  Apart from urging the government to pass the revised Manipur State AIDS Policy, 2010, in the ongoing assembly session, the memo sought to make all entitlement schemes and benefits available to PLHIVs.
  ,
  ,
  The memo urged the government to ensure that laboratory testing and investigations for HIV/AIDS patients be made free of cost in all government hospitals and Anti-Retroviral Therapy (ART) centres. This would include treatment for opportunistic infections and related illnesses like hepatitis C. The NGOs also demanded that basic amenities such as drinking water, sanitation and seating arrangements at all ART centres should be provided to PLHIVs.
  ,
  ,
  Manipur is one of India's six high HIV/AIDS prevalence states. According to the latest report prepared by Manipur State AIDS Control Society (Macs), the state has 43,707 PLHIVs. Of this number, 11,878 are women and 2,780 are children.
  ,
  ,
  As a result of the government's failure to implement such measures, PLHIVs face acute challenges in accessing basic healthcare, supportive medicine, food, education and housing. The memo highlighted the increasing poverty levels among Manipur's HIV positive community and stated that increasing prices was a major threat to the infected population as it decreased access to basic commodities.
  ,
  ,
  The NGOs demanded the appointment of adequate doctors in government hospitals to deal with HIV cases, especially gynecologists for female PLHIVs. Increasing accessibility of ART at treatment centres and installing and improving CD4 count and viral load testing machines at such centers were some of their other demands.

  GUWAHATI: With little awareness about increasing Hepatitis-C cases in the northeast, activists and medical practitioners warned that unless effective programmes were implemented, there would be a further escalation in the number of people falling prey to the dreaded virus.
  
  ,
  Often referred to as a viral time bomb, the disease is widespread among intravenous drug users (IDUs). Manipur's Surachanpur and Bishnupur districts have the highest number of people carrying the , (HCV), with prevalence rates among the districts' IDUs being nearly 90 per cent and 78 per cent respectively.
  ,
  ,
  In Nagaland's Wokha and Phek districts, the prevalence rate, as per an Integrated Bio Behavioural Assessment Round 2 Testing, conducted in 2009 by the , and others, was 20.8 per cent and 8.7 per cent respectively. Prior studies showed that in Manipur, the prevalence rate of HCV is 55 to 80 per cent among IDUs, as opposed to 22 to 33 per cent HIV prevalence among them.
  ,
  ,
  ""The main objective is to create awareness about viral Hepatitis in the region. The epidemic is at our doorstep, with people getting infected, testing positive and some deaths being reported. However, NGOs and the government continue to ignore the spread of the disease,"" said Ketho, general secretary of , (HEPCON).
  ,
  ,
  With much of the focus being restricted to HIV-AIDS and cancer awareness, HCV often escapes attention. With no proper cure or vaccine, course-related HCV treatment is also considered too expensive. People with HCV are prone to develop chronicity that can lead to liver damages. Research show that close to 75 to 85 per cent HCV patients develop chronicity, as opposed to Hepatitis-B patients (HBV).
  ,
  ,
  ""Intravenous drug users are the most vulnerable. HCV prevalence is much higher than that of HIV. This indicates that there is a bigger pool of HCV patients among IDUs,"" said Gajendra Kumar Medhi, doctor and scientist with the Indian Council of Medical Research.
  ,
  ,
  Another factor responsible for the high prevalence of HCV amongst IDUs is needle-sharing. Even with efforts to promote safe injecting practices, the prevalence of needle-sharing is quite high. Users may lessen sharing of syringes, but indirect sharing is widely practiced. Nearly 50 to 70 per cent IDUs admitted to sharing accessories like common containers for drug preparation, filter cotton and rinse water.

  KOLHAPUR: Vijay Suryavanshi, chief executive officer, ,, has mooted a proposal to share the information of detected HIV positive patients in Kolhapur with the primary health centre located near the patients' permanent addresses in Marathwada.
  
  ,
  Every year, some two lakh sugarcane cutters migrate to Kolhapur district alone on the job and are found to be vulnerable to HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases.
  ,
  ,
  ""Sugarcane cutters move from field to field over November to April every year. Once they return to their homes in Latur, Osmanabad, Ahmednagar and Beed districts, they should not miss their medication. We are working on a detailed plan to write to the primary health centres, informing them about the disease, the patients and their treatment,"" Suryavanshi said. The follow-up will help in controlling the disease and check its spread among other people, he said.
  ,
  ,
  Maharashtra State AIDS Control Society (MSACS) and National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) are working on this pilot project, where all sugarcane cutters are approached for medical examination and counselling. The medication and counselling is free.
  ,
  ,
  ""Sugarcane cutters are paid at one time; generally before the beginning of the cutting season. They carry cash with them and use it to pay sex workers. Often, sexual intercourse is unprotected; hence they are prone to HIV infection. Some of these workers are also engage in casual sex with female co-workers in their groups or a group travelling together from one field to another. In interior rural areas, no contraceptives are available. In such situations, the possibility of transmission of infection increases,"" said MSACS regional programme officer Jagdish Patil. Many sugarcane cutters have also been detected for HIV-tuberculosis co-infection, he said.

An erratic drug supply of second-line medication has forced thousands of patients—some from as far as Nagpur, Sindhudurg, Akola and even parts of Gujarat—to frequent the treatment centre multiple times a week to collect the drugs instead of the usual once-a-month practice.
  
  ,
  ""Most HIV-positive people hide their status at their workplace. We cannot afford to seek leave every alternate day to collect the medicines. Several people have lost their jobs because of this,"" said an , patient, adding that lately he has been asking for leave once every week. The Bhayander resident said he has already switched jobs twice as too many questions about his absenteeism were raised at the workplace.
  ,
  ,
  Another HIV-positive patient, a 37-year-old Sion resident, said he has been missing doses as his boss has started questioning his medical fitness. ""How many leaves can an office grant in a week? We cannot even buy the drugs from outside given the steep cost,"" he complained.
  ,
  ,
  Patients are livid that while other four ART centres—in Nagpur, Aurangabad, Pune and Sangli—have dealt with the medicine shortage by procuring them locally, the same zeal was lacking at JJ, which has been accused of inadequate supply of drugs for the last six months. The only centre to disburse second-line medicines in city, it also caters to patients from Konkan region.

She approached a mid-level hospital in Sundarapuram and got her admission form done. However, when she told the staff that she was HIV positive, they returned her admission and claimed they had too many patients lined up for colonoscopy for the next two days and didn't have a vacant bed even in the general ward. ""They asked me to a call three days later or better approach a government hospital for the test,"" she said.
  ,
  ,
  The Coimbatore Positive Network, a city-based NGO, said the polite rejection that Kamakshi received was better than usual. ""Almost all private hospitals in the city and surrounding districts refuse to treat or operate on HIV patients,"" said the network's president M Somesh. ""They tell patients that they don't have facilities or infrastructure to treat HIV positive people,"" he said. They tell them to go to government hospitals in Coimbatore or Pollachi, he added.
  ,
  ,
  A campaign by the network sensitization programmes held by , (TANSACS), three large hospitals have agreed to treat and operate HIV patients. ""We have got them to conduct around 15 deliveries so far,"" says Somesh. However, these hospitals charge HIV patients twice the amount they take from regular patients. ""They claim they have to purchase disposable instruments and gear such as gloves, masks, costumes which they have to dispose after one use and hence the higher charge,"" said Somesh. But we are glad that they at least treat us, so we have learned to bear the costs, he said.
  ,
  ,
  Though Coimbatore district has more than 10,300 registered HIV positive patients, the two government hospitals and one link centre are the only venues where a patient can get Anti retroviral therapy (ART) at subsidised rate. ""Even if other private hospitals offer ART, they do not tell us. In fact, hospitals that treat HIV positive patients do not want it to be known,"" said Somesh.
  ,
  ,
  Hospitals said they can't be blamed, because ART medication is expensive and the general public is scared of being treated along-side HIV positive patients. ""We have a separate wing to treat HIV patients, conduct surgeries and even do deliveries. We do not publicise it much because we do not want our general patients to live in fear of a transfusion mistake or infection,"" said a doctor at one of the hospitals that treat HIV patients. ""We do not want doctors to lose out on their normal patients,"" he added.
  ,
  ,
  Surprisingly, not a single complaint has been filed against any hospital for rejecting a HIV positive patient. ""We have not got any such complaints against a hospital so far,"" said Dr A S Valan, regional coordinator, TANSACS. ""When we get such a complaint we will refer it to the , and sensitise the particular hospital,"" he says. The law clearly mentions that HIV patients can't be discriminated against.

For example, you need to understand the stage of the virus and there are drugs which can't be prescribed along with ART drugs,"" said IMA state president Dr M Balasubramanian.

  CHENNAI: KG Hospitals on Friday afternoon admitted that there was ""some confusion"" about how the 16-year-old boy from Ooty could test positive for HIV. They admitted that the boy had tested negative for the virus before his , in December, but tested positive for it in March.

  The hospital claims they have clear records of the three people, whose blood was transfused into the boy, and tests to show that they were HIV negative. ""We do not know how the virus entered the boy's blood stream,"" admitted the hospital's chairman K G Bhakthavatchalam.
  ,
  ,
  ""December could have been a window period for the virus, so it did not show in the blood tests done in December,"" he added. Insisting that his hospital was not responsible for transfusing HIV positive blood into the boy, he claimed that it could've happened ""during any usual treatment administered during the boy's childhood"".
  ,
  ,
  The boy had been treated by the hospital for more than three months for kidney failure. Both his kidneys had failed; he was undergoing dialysis and needed a transplant urgently.

  ,
  Doctors admit that the ""window period theory"" could have happened, but say a detailed viral load test is required to confirm the virus and monitor the infection. Doctors say if the boy is infected with HIV type 1, there are incidents of the virus strain not showing up in blood tests for months or even years after it enters a person's blood stream. ""It may have entered due to a mistake that happened much earlier,"" said a doctor.

  ""The viral load test will also give us an idea of the danger it poses immediately, how it should be treated and how long the virus may have been present in the boy,"" says Dr Soundaravel, assistant resident medical officer of , and Hospital (CMCH) indicating that it could hold clues to the above controversy. The viral load test would also indicate whether he needs antiretroviral therapy. ""His CD 4 cell count should be checked regularly to monitor his body's immune system, especially since he is undergoing dialysis treatment and will be on immunosuppressant drugs,"" he added. ""He will have to undergo dialysis for the rest of his life, and if his CD4 count falls he should be very careful with infections,"" he further added.

  In the run-up to the colourful slugfest called electioneering, a motley group of people cried out in the wilderness of our mushrooming urban jungle. Not just ill-informed and superstitious Khap Panchayats but even our educated and intelligent health service providers have apparently added a fifth 'varna' to our patriarchal, parochial, and stratified society. At the very bottom of the heap are the new untouchables - those who are denied c-sections, gallbladder and other surgical interventions, those who can't get broken bones mended - children, women, and men testing positive for ,.
  
  ,
  The first-ever survey conducted by HIV positive people (also called PLHA) on HIV positive people in Patna came to light recently. So much is the fear of being ostracized that 50% of those surveyed haven't disclosed their status to their family while 77% haven't disclosed their status to close friends. While 5% lost their share of property, 2% of the women were thrown out of their homes. As many as 34% of those employed face problems at the workplace after their HIV status became known. However, the majority of the survey sample consisted of those in the informal sector.
  ,
  ,
  The , (CHMU) presented their findings on issues and problems of people with HIV and AIDS in a consultation attended by prominent members of the , fraternity, including representatives from state government bodies, NGOs, doctors, lawyers and so on. The report reflected the growing anxiety of PLHA and their families about the denial of surgical procedures and treatment by government doctors, some incidents of which have been highlighted in the local media.
  ,
  ,
  By and large, BSACS (,) and the state government have ensured regular and timely dispensing of ART (antiretroviral therapy) medicines that PLHA need with 94% of the survey respondents giving positive responses about the facilities available in Patna (PMCH and RMRI). But no PLHA gets treatment for opportunistic infections from the PHCs (primary health centres). Greater coordination is needed between BSACS, government and civil society to address issues that go beyond the mere distribution of free medicines.
  ,
  ,
  ""Doctors belong to the educated and enlightened section of our society, but there are among them (those) who practice untouchability vis-a-vis persons with HIV,"" said the report. The doctors attending the event claimed there were orthopaedic surgeons and gynaecologists in the city who have never refused to operate on patients with HIV, but these can be counted on the finger of one hand, says Chandy Joseph of CHMU.
  ,
  ,
  The conference recognized that surgeons fear , by coming into contact with infected body fluids during operative procedures, and government hospitals are not provided good quality protective gear. It strongly recommended that the government supply adequate protective kits to surgical departments to deal with this issue.
  ,
  ,
  Doctors Diwakar Tejaswi and A K Singh said the government should turn its attention to upgrading four key factors that impact PLHA and are linked to prejudice against them. These factors include doctors and training programmes, availability of post-prick prophylaxis, availability of protection kits and care and nursing services training for serving PLHA.
  ,
  ,
  The doctors recommended that the government should conduct trainings and orientations for medical service providers and paramedics on how to provide services to PLHA, and enlist as resource persons surgeons such as Dr John Mukhopadhyay, Dr Manoj Kumar and others who regularly perform surgical interventions for PLHA so that there could be a sharing of ideas that will lead to a reduction in stigma and discrimination.
  ,
  ,
  The conference also recommended that PLHA should be entitled to BPL status and accorded the entitlements by virtue of their condition in the spirit of the Supreme Court judgments. This status could be provided on the basis of the ART card. Special efforts should be made to ensure that the Right to Education Act norms of elementary education effectively covers children with HIV.
  ,
  ,
  The positive attitude of the representatives of the PLHA attending the conference was remarkable. ""Yes, many of us face discrimination, even abuse, but we are not here to point fingers. Let's educate each other, understand our fears, and engage with civil society and government more actively,"" said Sanjeet Singh, the person who has successfully used the PIL route to bring relief to affected members of the PLHA community.

  ,
  The health of the , depends on a symbiotic/mutually beneficial relationship with ""good"" bacteria that live on its surface feeding on products produced by vaginal skin cells.
  ,
  ,
  These good bacteria, in turn, create a physical and chemical barrier to bad bacteria and viruses including HIV.
  ,
  ,
  The researchers are the first to grow human vaginal skin cells in a dish in a manner that creates surfaces that support colonisation by the complex good and bad communities of bacteria collected from women during routine gynecological exams.
  ,
  ,
  The bacteria communities have never before been successfully grown outside a human.

  ,
  By using this model of the human vagina, researchers discovered that certain bacterial communities alter the way HIV infects and replicates.

  Their laboratory model will allow careful and controlled evaluation of the complex community of bacteria to ultimately identify those species that weaken the defenses against HIV.

But based on our studies of blood samples collected from 17 patients, we found that for 150mg of rifabutin to work, patients would have to take the drug every day,"" said Dr Geetha Ramachandran, who led the study. , The subjects of the study were all patients at Government Hospital of Thoracic Medicine, Tambaram. All of them had failed to respond to first-line treatment. , Researchers found that the RNTCP stipulated dosage administered to seven patients was too low to counter the disease. Four of the subjects died during the course of the study. , ""Ten of the patients, who received a dosage of around 30mg/ml higher than that prescribed by the RNTCP, showed favourable response to the treatment,"" Dr Ramachandran said. , Experts say the dosage of the drug has always been a matter of debate, with doctors exercising extra caution due to possible chemical interaction of medicines for HIV and TB. , ""While in some countries like the US, the dosage of rifabutin has been increased from 150mg three days a week to the same amount daily, in India insufficient data and studies resulted in health authorities failing to increase the dosage,"" NIRT director Soumya Swaminathan said. , The researchers have presented the results of the study to the National AIDS Control Organisation. ""A multi-centric study will be undertaken in different parts of the country to assess the effect of rifabutin.

  JAIPUR: New multi-drug antiretroviral (ARV) regimen has been initiated in the state aiming to further reduce the risk of vertical HIV transmission from HIV infected mother to her newborn. The decision has been taken to promote birth of HIV-free children.
  
  ,
  The , (RSACS) has initiated lifelong multi-drug antiretroviral (ARV) regimens for all pregnant and breast-feeding , living with HIV. The transmission of HIV from infected mother to her newborn is one of the leading causes of spread of HIV. According to RSACS, it is estimated that 5.2% of total HIV infections are due to transmission of HIV from mother to newborn.
  ,
  ,
  To deal with it, earlier the RSACS was providing single dose of Nevirapine to such women at the time of labour pain to prevent the HIV transmission from mother to her newborn baby. But, from May 19, the RSACS has changed its strategy.
  ,
  ,
  Health department's project director (AIDS) Dr SS Chauhan said, ""From an HIV infected mother, the risk of vertical transmission of HIV to newborn is 30%. But, a single dose of Nevirapine reduces the risk to around 15%. So far we were giving single dose of Nevirapine to pregnant women at the time of delivery. But, still the high risk (up to 15%) remained the cause of concern for us. Now, to bring down the percentage of risk of vertical transmission of HIV from mother to her newborn, we have initiated the lifelong ART (triple drug regimen). The multidrug ARV regimen would further decrease the risk from 11% to up to 5%. It will be the major benefit of the new multidrug regimen.""
  ,
  ,
  The triple drug regimen includes — Tenofovir, Lamivudine and Efavirenz. The three drugs would be administered to the women living with HIV and her infant. The drug would continue lifelong to reduce mortality and morbidity in mothers and children.
  ,
  ,
  The RSACS is spreading awareness of HIV testing among pregnant women. They take consent of pregnant women for HIV testing. If the women test positive for HIV, they link the women with anti retroviral therapy centre. Also, they put effort to prevent the transmission of HIV to her newborn.

"Updated: Jun 23, 2014, 10:11 IST",'Decision not to admit HIV+ students painful',"

  MARGAO: For an institution which has worked dedicatedly for the welfare of the marginalized young and the poor from the village since its inception, denying admission to the HIV+ students was definitely a painful one for the Sulcorna-based high school.
  
  ,
  Particularly because it was a reversal of its own conscious and bold decision taken only a few days ago to admit those students on ""humanitarian grounds"".
  ,
  ,
  When the Salesian priests came to Sulcorna over 50 years ago, they transformed large swathes of jungle areas into a farm, growing sugarcane, cashew, and other cash crops, employing locals as farmhands and helping the needy.
  ,
  ,
  Today the Don Bosco Agro-Ed Complex at Sulcorna, situated on a sprawling lush land, has grown into a hub of educational, agricultural and social activities.
  ,
  ,
  ""Besides playing a pioneering role in the remote villages along this hinterland belt in the field of agriculture, horticulture, watershed development etc, the activities of ,, have always been village-centric. We have taken utmost care of the villagers all these years and the locals hold us in high esteem. We are always the first to reach out to them in their times of need. We have always fought for protecting the interests of the villagers. We have helped them form self-help groups and cooperative societies, besides helping the young in gaining employment. Though our students come from a poor background, they excel in studies and are on par with those from the urban schools. Our relationship with the villagers is close knit and we share a mutual trust,"" sources in the school management told TOI.
  ,
  ,
  Sources within the local community confirmed that it was exactly because of the villagers' sense of attachment and belonging to Don Bosco school that they felt ""let down"" by the school management when it granted admission to HIV positive students residing ""far away"" from the village.
  ,
  ,
  The school management is now concerned about the probable withdrawal of students by their parents in case admission is granted to the HIV positive students. The HIV positive students have also been denied admission in at least two other schools located in the vicinity of the children's home in which they are lodged, it is reliably learnt.
  ,
  ,
  It was exactly because of such discrimination against HIV positive students that the Naz Foundation (India) Trust, an organization which runs a care home for orphaned and vulnerable children, had moved the ,, invoking the fundamental rights to life, education and equality guaranteed under the Indian Constitution.
  ,
  ,
  The foundation had pointed out that based on their own HIV status or that of their parents or guardians, children affected by HIV face multiple forms of discrimination in schools. It was on this PIL that on March 3, the Supreme Court issued notices to the Centre and all states to declare HIV positive children as a disadvantaged group under the Right to Education (RTE) Act to ensure they got education without discrimination.
  ,
  ,
  Section 9(c) of the Act says, ""Every local authority shall ensure that the child belonging to weaker section and the child belonging to disadvantaged group are not discriminated against and prevented from pursuing and completing elementary education on any grounds.""

"Jun 21, 2014, 00:31 IST",Parents object to HIV+ kids joining Sulcorna school,"

  PANAJI: Over 80 children living at a children's home in Zambaulim are yet to begin attending classes this academic year. As they innocently await a new set of books and uniforms, the nuns who run the home are struggling to find a school willing to admit the children.
  
  ,
  The problem arose when the nuns approached a school close to the home and the children were refused admission as 14 of them were HIV+. Despite there being two other schools closer to the institute, the nuns then approached a school in Sulcorna, that is about 15km away.
  ,
  ,
  The , decided to admit the children, but ran into trouble when parents objected. Sources in the Sulcorna school management said parents of other students objected to HIV+ children sharing space with their children and threatened to pull out their children from the school if the HIV+ children were admitted.
  ,
  ,
  ?Some parents even sought school leaving certificates for their children, school sources said.
  ,
  ,
  Speaking to TOI, the head of the children's institute said, ""The parents believe that if their children mingle with children with HIV, they would be exposed to the infection.""
  ,
  ,
  To allay such fears, Indian medical association (IMA) Goa state president Dr Jagadish Cacodkar had a session with the school's parent teachers association (PTA) to explain that ""merely mixing with HIV positive persons does not pass the infection"".
  ,
  ,
  Some 200 PTA members attended the session and Cacodkar claimed they appeared satisfied with the explanation and reasoning.
  ,
  ,
  Cacodkar said the opposition by parents was a result of misconception. ""The main reason parents object is because AIDS is incurable. The psychological fear of contracting a deadly disease coupled with misconception about its transition has compounded their ignorance. Their biggest misconception is that HIV is contagious,"" he said.
  ,
  ,
  ""They were explained why it is not possible to get an infection if you touch a HIV positive person, share a seat with one or even when you eat from a common plate,"" he said.
  ,
  ,
  Even late Friday evening, the nuns were in talks with the parents and the school management, and remained hopeful that all the children from their home will be admitted. ""I can say that 95% of the problem is sorted out. Consultative efforts to change the outlook of parents seems to be finally yielding results,"" the nun said.
  ,
  ,
  Until last academic year the 14 HIV positive children were schooled in the home. It was only this year that, emboldened by the Supreme Court decision in March that asked Central and state governments to end discrimination against HIV positive children during school admission, the nuns decided to admit them in a public school.
  ,
  ,
  While they almost succeeded, their attempt was derailed by parents.

"Jun 19, 2014, 01:37 IST",HIV rapist's death sentence commuted,"

  PUNE: The Bombay High Court has commuted to life the death sentence awarded to a 29-year-old HIV patient, from Pune. He had raped his seven-year-old niece and then strangled her at Kasegaon village in Sangli in 2011.
  
  ,
  The bench comprising justices V K Tahilramani and V L Achliya observed, ""There can be no doubt that the offence committed by the accused deserves severe condemnation and it is a heinous crime, but on looking at the cumulative facts and on balancing the aggravating and mitigating circumstances of the case, we do not think that the case falls in the category of rarest of rare cases. Hence, we are not inclined to confirm the death sentence.""
  ,
  ,
  On March 26, 2013, the district and sessions court at Islampur had convicted and sentenced him to death for raping and murdering the girl. The victim, a resident of Sangli, was studying in standard two in a local school.
  ,
  ,
  The prosecution's case is that on February 26, 2011, the man had taken the girl from school to Kalammawadi, near Kasegaon in Walva tehsil and raped her in a sugarcane field. He then strangled her and fled to Pune. When the girl did not come back from school, her mother told her husband.
  ,
  ,
  He inquired with the school teacher who had told him that she had gone with her maternal uncle. After a search, the girl's father registered a criminal case with the , station.
  ,
  ,
  The rapist was arrested after investigations revealed his involvement in the crime. The victim's body was recovered from the sugarcane field.
  ,
  ,
  The trial court had sentenced him to death under section 302 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). He was sentenced to life imprisonment for rape under section 376 (2) (f) of the IPC. He was also sentenced to three years' rigorous imprisonment each for kidnapping and destroying evidence under sections 363 and 201 of the IPC.
  ,
  ,
  The trial court had sent a reference to the high court for confirming the death sentence. He had also filed a criminal appeal challenging the death sentence in the high court.
  ,
  ,
  Additional public prosecutor , relied on aggravating circumstances to prove that the accused had brutally raped and murdered a defenceless girl. She pleaded to confirm death sentence as the girl was last seen in the company of the accused.
  ,
  ,
  She relied on the DNA report to prove that the blood stains found on the victim's frock matched his blood group. She submitted that the rapist was a habitual offender as he had two cases registered against him with the , station here in 2009 and 2011. The HC later found that he had been acquitted in both the cases.
  ,
  ,
  The HC appointed lawyer , to represent the man from its legal aid committee. Apte argued that police had not recorded his statement to show that the dead body was recovered at his instance.
  ,
  ,
  He also challenged the identification parade of the accused on the grounds that the witnesses had seen him at the police station.
  ,
  ,
  The HC's observations Quoting several , judgments, the HC bench said, ""The man was suffering from HIV and this was the only mitigating circumstance in his favour for commuting his death sentence to life imprisonment.""
  ,
  ,
  The HC also sought his doctor's advice on whether his life span will be that of an ordinary man if he continued with the medicines. While partly allowing his appeal, the HC on examining the evidence maintained his conviction under sections of the IPC, but commuted the death sentence given for murder to life imprisonment.
  ,
  ,
  The HC also commuted the life imprisonment awarded for rape to 10 years RI. However, both the sentences will run consecutively. The sentences of three years RI each awarded for kidnapping and destruction of evidence will run concurrently. The judgment was delivered on May 8 and posted on the HC website on June 18.

  ""We discussed the issue threadbare and felt that there is a need for creating more awareness in rural areas. We have decided on a strategy for generating awareness about the disease.

",Massive blow: 'Miracle girl' cured of HIV as a baby is suffering from virus again,"LONDON: A four-year-old girl who had emerged as the beacon of hope for the global fight against AIDS, when she was cured of HIV after being born to an infected mother has now been found with ""detectable levels of HIV"". , In a massive blow to scientists, the child known as the ""Mississippi baby"" who when put on antiretroviral therapy (ART) within 30 hours of birth was cured last year by halting the formation of hard-to-treat viral reservoirs — dormant cells responsible for reigniting the infection in most HIV patients within weeks of stopping the therapy has now been found to have been re-infected after more than two years of not taking ART., , ""Certainly, this is a disappointing turn of events for this young child, the medical staff involved in the child's care, and the HIV/AIDS research community,"" said NIAID director Anthony S Fauci. ""Scientifically, this development reminds us that we still have much more to learn about the intricacies of HIV infection and where the virus hides in the body""., , A routine clinical care visit earlier this month has revealed that the child has detectable HIV levels in the blood (16,750 copies/mL). Repeat viral load blood testing performed 72 hours later confirmed this finding (10,564 copies/mL of virus)., , Additionally, the child had decreased levels of CD4+ T-cells, a key component of a normal immune system, and the presence of HIV antibodies — signals of an actively replicating pool of virus in the body., , The child was again started on ART. Genetic sequencing of the virus indicated that the child's HIV infection was the same strain acquired from the mother., , , , , The child continues to receive medical care, treatment and monitoring from Hannah Gay, a pediatric HIV specialist at the University of Mississippi Medical Center who has been involved in the child's care since birth., , Researchers say they will now work to better understand what enabled the child to remain off treatment for more than two years without detectable virus or measurable immunologic response and what might be done to extend the period of sustained HIV remission in the absence of ART., , ""The fact that this child was able to remain off antiretroviral treatment for two years and maintain quiescent virus for that length of time is unprecedented,"" said Deborah Persaud, professor of infectious diseases at the John Hopkins Children's Center in Baltimore and one of the two pediatric HIV experts involved in the ongoing analysis of the case. ""Typically, when treatment is stopped, HIV levels rebound within weeks, not years""., , , , , ""The case of the Mississippi child indicates that early antiretroviral treatment in this HIV-infected infant did not completely eliminate the reservoir of HIV-infected cells that was established upon infection but may have considerably limited its development and averted the need for antiretroviral medication over a considerable period,"" said Dr Fauci., , ""Now we must direct our attention to understanding why that is and determining whether the period of sustained remission in the absence of therapy can be prolonged even further."", , HIV first sprung its head over 30 years ago and has till now infected over 34 million people worldwide., , Finding a vaccine against HIV has been a daunting challenge., , The UN estimates that 330,000 babies were infected in 2011. This is apart from more than three million children living with HIV around the world., , In India, more than 14,000 children got infected in 2011, which accounted for 13% decline compared to 2009. The number of estimated deaths among children (0-14 years old) due to AIDS was 10,213 in 2011., , In India, children accounted for 7% of an estimated 21 lakh people living with HIV/AIDS in 2011. Around 40% (8.16 lakh) of them were women, who are likely to pass on the virus to their children., , The baby in question was born prematurely in a Mississippi clinic in 2010 to an HIV-infected mother who did not receive ART medication during pregnancy and was not diagnosed with HIV infection until the time of delivery. Because of the high risk of HIV exposure, the infant was started at 30 hours of age on liquid, triple-drug antiretroviral treatment. Testing confirmed within several days that the baby had been infected with HIV. At two weeks of age, the baby was discharged from the hospital and continued on liquid antiretroviral therapy., , The baby continued on antiretroviral treatment until 18 months of age, when the child was lost to follow up and no longer received treatment. Yet, when the child was again seen by medical staff five months later, blood samples revealed undetectable HIV levels (less than 20 copies of HIV per milliliter of blood (copies/mL)) and no HIV-specific antibodies. The child continued to do well in the absence of antiretroviral medicines and was free of detectable HIV for more than two years., , ""The prolonged lack of viral rebound, in the absence of HIV-specific immune responses, suggests that the very early therapy not only kept this child clinically well, but also restricted the number of cells harboring HIV infection,"" said Katherine Luzuriaga, professor of molecular medicine at the University of Massachusetts Medical School., , A Global Plan on HIV has two main targets for 2015: a 90% reduction in the number of children newly infected with HIV and a 50% reduction in the number of AIDS-related maternal deaths.

"Jul 14, 2014, 00:52 IST",HIV stigma: strategic long-term plan vital,"

  With the issue of , related stigma and discrimination being addressed in the state, I have attempted to put more light on the issue. There is need to understand the issue, not only in relation to the children who are facing discrimination, but close to 14,000 odd HIVpositive individuals found positive in Goa. Rivona case should help us to strategize for a long term impact.
  
  ,
  Goa had set an example to the rest of country three decades ago and had created an impact in addressing HIV-related stigma and discrimination. India's first HIV litigation arose when HIVpositive activist Dominic D'Souza was incarcerated in the late 1980s. D'Souza, a resident of Goa, was found to be HIVpositive when he donated blood at a Goa hospital. The test was performed without his knowledge or consent, and the results were revealed not to him, but to the local police.
  ,
  ,
  D'Souza was subsequently arrested and confined in an unused TB sanatorium pursuant to the Goa, Daman and Diu Public Health Act, 1985, an amendment to which in 1986 authorized the state to mandatorily test any person for HIV and isolate them if they tested HIVpositive.
  ,
  ,
  He challenged the Goa Public Health Amendment Act, which called for mandatory isolation of an HIVpositive person. He won a partial victory when the court ruled detainment was mandatory only in a ""justifiable"" case. His legacy continues through Positive, the NGO he started to help people living with HIV.
  ,
  ,
  Dominic's case highlighted several aspects of the laws that are related to the HIV epidemic beyond the application (or mis-application) of public health laws. Dominic was tested for HIV without his consent, his confidentiality was breached, and eventually, when he was released, he had lost his job.
  ,
  ,
  Since that first case, violations of the rights of people living with or affected by HIV have increasingly come to light, many legal cases have been fought and won or lost, and many judgments have been pronounced by the courts.
  ,
  ,
  It should be understood that those who stigmatize people living with HIV falsely believe that the virus is highly contagious and that they could easily become infected. When that happens, others start to view HIV-positive as a threat. Many become isolated - within their homes, in public, at their workplaces. They are further stigmatized by others' assumptions about their moral integrity - such as the belief that they became infected with HIV because they chose to take part in risky behaviors.
  ,
  ,
  Also, stigma and discrimination continue to undermine prevention, treatment and care of people living with the HIV and AIDS. It hinders those with the virus from telling their partners about their status. It threatens their access to health care. It increases their vulnerability to physical violence. And HIV-related stigma affects people's ability to earn a living, making it even more difficult for them to lift themselves out of poverty.
  ,
  ,
  HIV and AIDS have highlighted such vast inequities, violent abuse and widespread stigma, that human rights have been violated in a manner and on a scale rarely witnessed before in the public health sphere. The HIV epidemic cannot be looked upon as just a medical problem. It touches on the most personal behaviours and aspects of people's lives, and its effect is felt in every sphere of a person's life. Combating it therefore demands an approach that integrates social, cultural, economic and human rights perspectives.
  ,
  ,
  While we discuss this, I wish to bring to fore more issues related to this. Once an adolescent finds out about his or her HIV status, disclosure, safer sex and family planning become pressing issues, requiring services tailored to the specific needs of adolescents. Despite the growing importance of this population group, they are largely left out of HIV/AIDS responses in the state. One effect is that existing paediatric and adult services are often ill-equipped to deal with their complex needs.
  ,
  ,
  This emerging situation underscores the need to recognize these adolescents in Goa as well, learn more about their lives, identify their preventive information needs and service priorities, and design appropriate programs for their special needs. Civil society organizations and the state at large, need to have planned and sustainable programmes for children, rather address issues as they come to the fore.
  ,
  ,
  While, I highlight the above, I also wish to bring to the attention of public at large, some of the instances of stigma and discrimination faced by people living with HIV in Goa. Discrimination in medical setting is widely prevalent. Surprisingly, even I came across staff of an NGO working in the premises of GMC to provide services, identifying HIV patients and alerting others to maintain distance. Some who are availing 50% bus concession from KTC also face discrimination by conductors who sometimes grill them on the card and also deny them concession. Most of the migrant PLHIVs, including children are denied social entitlement and social security schemes. People accessing DSS schemes are constantly under fear and sometimes refrain from accessing schemes due to fear of status being revealed.
  ,
  ,
  The government besides providing some social entitlements should also focus on long term HIV impact mitigation. It's high time that all stakeholders working to address HIV in the state come together on a common platform and address HIV through need-based, planned and sustained programmes. It requires commitment, courage and leadership at all levels.

  Altogether, 2437 HIV positive people from Tuensang district of Nagaland are facing uncertainty about their present status of HIV drug treatment. CD4 testing is important in HIV treatment as it puts newly detected patients on Anti Retroviral (ARV) for regular monitoring of the present treatment.

  MELBOURNE: The elusive quest for an , received a boost at the , on Tuesday as , said they had forced the , out of a hiding place where it had lurked after being suppressed by drugs.
  
  ,
  The experiment, carried out with six HIV-infected volunteers, is an important advance in the so-called kick-and-kill approach for a cure, they said.
  ,
  ,
  The technique aims to force the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) from its last redoubt after it is beaten back by antiretroviral drugs. These drugs can bring HIV in the blood to below detectable levels, enabling sick patients to return almost miraculously to normal life. But the therapy has to be taken every day, is costly and carries potential side effects.
  ,
  ,
  If the drugs are stopped, HIV usually rebounds within a few weeks and starts once more to infect other immune cells, exposing the body to opportunistic microbes.
  ,
  ,
  For the past three years, scientists have focused on ways to kick HIV out of its bolthole and then kill the hideaway cells. In a presentation at the International AIDS Conference in Melbourne, researchers from Aarhus University in Denmark described a step forward in the first stage of this process.
  ,
  ,
  Six patients on antiretrovirals took an anti-cancer drug called romidepsin, which prompted virus production in HIV-infected cells to crank up to between 2.1 and 3.9 times above normal. In five patients, the level of virus in the blood increased to measurable levels, an important threshold. agencies

""If there is an accidental prick by an HIV-infected needle, the person must undergo prophylactic treatment at the Anti-Retroviral Therapy (ART) centre at Rims.

  ,
  While GSACS is given credit for generating awareness about the deadly disease among high-risk groups such as commercial sex workers, truck drivers, motorcycle pilots, the Sanguem incident emphasizes the GSACS' need to also focus on the general population and work towards eliminating stigma attached to HIV AIDS.
  ,
  ,
  Raj Vaidya who works for Positive People, a NGO working for ,, says besides creating awareness, more importantly, GSACS will have to now work towards doing away with stigma, and discrimination that HIV-infected people face.

  ,
  ""A lot of work has to be done,"" he says indicating that it will be a mammoth task.
  ,

  Vandana Patankar, project director, GSACS, who is well aware of the task before her, said though they have started awareness programmes and workshops are being conducted, she says it will be a while before people come to really understand the issue and bury their prejudices.
  ,
  ,
  She said the issue is complicated as there is no cure for HIV/AIDS. Present day parents, most of whom have one or two children, become too protective about their children even though HIV is not contagious.
  ,
  ,
  ""Two or three decades ago, parents rarely bothered who their children's classmates in schools were, with whom they play with. But today the scene is different,"" she says.

  A school teacher from a Mapusa school said many teachers are themselves ignorant about the disease or at times, despite of being well aware that merely touching or sitting next to a HIV-positive person will not get them an infection, they will still refuse to mix with HIV-positive persons. ""This I have gathered from hearing teachers talk in the staffroom. What they feel about HIV-infected people. It is sad,"" she said.

  ,
  She feels efforts should be made on all fronts to enlighten people about HIV, so that infected people are treated with dignity.

  The issue was discussed at the first roundtable consultation on viral hepatitis organized by WHO at ,.

  There are five main hepatitis viruses, of which B and C cause the most fatalities as these can lead to liver cirrhosis and cancer. Dr Seguy said preventive measures such as compulsory vaccination for Hepatitis B, promoting safe sex and screening of blood for infections at the time of transfusion can help check the spread of diseases.

"Anupam Saxena,Updated: Aug 7, 2014, 11.01AM IST",First impressions: Xolo 8X-1000 and HIVE UI,"NEW DELHI: In a bid to differentiate itself from other Android smartphone vendors, Indian handset brand Xolo has introduced a new software user interface which it calls HIVE.
, 
, The interface is more than just a UI skin and features native apps and services that have been designed in-house by Xolo's software team and freelance artists commissioned by the company.
, 
, It's essentially a direction taken by the likes of Xiaomi and Oppo, and to some extent, HTC and Samsung. To showcase the new software interface, Xolo has also introduced 8X-1000, its first octa-core processor-powered smartphone. We got an opportunity to experience the phone and here are our first impressions.
, 
, 
,
, 
, At first look, the 8X-1000 looks like any other budget Android smartphone. Of course the form is closer to the Sony Xperia school of design than to others, with its rectangular shape, corners that are not very rounded, straight lines and even a glass back. The company has put Corning Gorilla Glass 3 at the back and Asahi Dragontrail glass at the front, to protect it from scratches and minor damage.
, 
, The phone is on the chunky side (Xolo has not revealed the weight) and not very thin at 7.9mm. The right edge sports the volume rocker and power keys, which offer decent tactile feedback. There are two ejectable trays on both right and left edges for the sim cards and the microSD card.
, 
, The front panel has three capacitive, backlit buttons that don't have labelling except for dots, just placed below the display. The back sports Xolo branding and an 8MP rear camera lens, along with an LED flash. As we mentioned, the back has a glass panel attached to some other material (probably plastic that bears matte finish) that slightly slides down to join the edges of the phone.
, 
, The bottom edge features two speaker grills. We were not able to play audio files during the hands-on so we'll only be able to comment on the quality of audio output in our detailed review.
, 
, 
,
, 
, The top edge sports the microUSB port and the 3.5mm headset jack. Overall, , feels like a decent budget phone in term of build and design.
, 
, The phone's 5-inch 720p display looks bright and vivid, and offers good viewing angles. We were not able to use the phone outdoors so it's difficult to comment on the sunlight legibility.
, 
, The phone sports an 8MP rear camera that features a Sony lens, and a front-facing camera with 2MP resolution. We'll have a detailed look at the camera in our full review. We're a little disappointed that Xolo has decided to power the phone with a low capacity, 1,920mAh battery but we'll only be able to gauge the battery backup after using the phone for a few days.
, 
, 
,
, 
, Xolo 8X-1000 runs Android 4.4 KitKat, the latest version of the OS with its own , interface. Xolo has customized all elements of the OS including the app launcher, quick settings toggles, Phone and Contact apps, gallery and media apps, among others.
, 
, The phone comes with themes and a store called 'Edge' that offers downloadable themes and other content. The themes change the entire look and feel of the UI, including the icons, lock screen and system apps. Xolo has also tweaked the app launcher to offer the ability to arrange apps alphabetically, frequency, and time of use. The task switcher takes inspiration from iOS 7's multitasking menu and adds a RAM cleaner button similar to Xiaomi's MIUI.
, 
, 
,
, 
, HIVE features Xolo's Fusion X media player that integrates the music player, video tracks and radio into one centralized app. The app comes with Last.fm integration to offer artist recommendations. It's an evolved version of the Fusion player we've seen on Lava phones and looks good.
, 
, The Contacts app provides a unified view of message threads and call logs of every contact and syncs with Gmail and Facebook.
, 
, Xolo also offers a 'Connect' app that allows you to offer feedback including new ideas to Xolo's software team. It also lets you connect with other Xolo users interested in providing feedback.
, 
, There are a number of other UI tweaks that make the interface distinct from stock Android. In our brief time with the phone, we found the UI to be pleasant although there were a few rough edges. The UI is not as attractive and elegant as Xiaomi's MIUI. People who like to customize their phones will certainly like it.
, 
, 
,
, 
, Coming to hardware, the Xolo 8X-1000 is powered by a 1.4GHz MediaTek octa-core processor and 2GB RAM. In our hands-on time with the phone, we experienced some minor lag with a few themes but other than that navigation was smooth. We'll put the phone through its paces to let you know if it's worth a buy in our full review.

"Updated: Aug 16, 2014, 09:39 IST",Trangender HIV deaths rise despite drop in TN fatalities,"

  CHENNAI: Has Tamil Nadu been successful in its battle against ,? Yes and no.
  
  ,
  The state recorded a marked decline in incidence of HIV infection and deaths from AIDS between 2009 and 2013 among both men and women. However, in what is both a pointer to the vulnerability of the third gender and an indictment of a failure in social inclusiveness, the mortality rate of HIV-positive transgenders in the state increased by more than 1,600% over the same period.
  ,
  ,
  ,
  ,
  ,
   , (TNSACS) statistics, sourced by TOI through an RTI petition, show that 1,537 men and 814 women died of HIV/AIDS-related causes in 2009. Effective intervention by the state led to a decline in the numbers to 1,323 male and 595 female HIV/AIDS deaths in 2013, a fall of 18.42%.
  ,
  ,
  Tamil Nadu — one of the four worst HIV/AIDS affected states along with Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Maharashtra — recorded only seven transgender deaths in 2009. The number climbed exponentially to 113 in 2013.
  ,
  ,
  If this does not appear to be strikingly high number, consider that the latest census statistics put the number of transgenders in the country at 4.9 lakh out of a total population in excess of 120 crore. That is 0.04% of the general population. By comparison, the HIV/AIDS mortality rate for transgenders by population in Tamil Nadu is 5.56%.
  ,
  ,
  Also, activists say, the actual numbers could be far higher because transgender deaths are hugely underreported.
  ,
  ,
  ""Social stigma prevents the reporting of transgender deaths,"" says A J Hariharan, founder of NGO ,, which works for the welfare of the sex workers and transgenders. According to the TNSACS data, the number of HIV-positive cases in the state dropped from 25,572 in 2009 to 17,055 in 2013, with the number of HIV-infected males decreasing from 14,835 to 9,868 and women from 10,665 to 7,127 over the same period.
  ,
  ,
  The figures raise several disconcerting questions. Have Tamil Nadu's highly acclaimed efforts to stem the spread of the disease not been an unqualified success? Is social inclusiveness a myth when it comes to transgenders despite several government initiatives to bring the community into the mainstream?
  ,
  ,
  Tamil Nadu was the first state to create a special welfare board for transgenders and provide them land, pension and separate ration cards. The Election Commission in 2009 created a separate entry for transgenders on voter lists. But transgenders say the welfare board has ceased to function.
  ,
  ,
  ""It was after Tamil Nadu that other states like Maharashtra set up welfare board for transgenders. But unfortunately the board for all purposes does not exist,"" says R Jeeva, founder of NGO Transgender Rights Association and a former member of the welfare board.
  ,
  ,
  Other officials say lack of awareness is probably the main cause for the rise in deaths of transgenders. ""The increase in deaths of HIV-positive transgenders is a concern. It is most likely linked to unsafe sex,"" said Dr Vijaya Raman, deputy director of Tamil Nadu AIDS Initiative (TAI).
  ,
  ,
  But transgenders say they have little choice in the matter. Latha S, a 30-year-old transgender says she's a prostitute by compulsion and not by choice. While that may be true of most women and men who sell sex for money, individuals of the third gender — stigmatised, ridiculed and shunned — have far fewer chances of opting out of the profession than others.
  ,
  ,
  Latha says she did not have an education and no one would give her a job. ""I have been in the profession ever since I discovered I was a transgender and joined the community,"" she says. ""Once I left home there was no one to educate me or help me get employed.""
  ,
  ,
  Her job, Latha says, involves violence from drunks and rowdies. ""Customers often do not pay and policemen harass us and force us to pay a large chunk of what we earn for protection,"" she says.
  ,
  ,
  ""I hate being a prostitute but I don't know what else to do,"" she says. What is worst, she says, is the vulnerability that she and other transgenders face and the constant fear it engenders.
  ,
  ,
  Transgenders usually leave home when they are around 16 years old, says A J Hariharan, the founder secretary of Indian Community Welfare Organisation (ICWO), an NGO that works for the welfare of the homeless, sex workers and transgenders. ""They join other transgenders and are pushed into begging and prostitution,"" he says. ""Lack of basic education means they are unable to get jobs and the stigma attached to them means even manual labour is not an option.""
  ,
  ,
  Hariharan says companies could, as part of their corporate social responsibility programmes, look to help transgenders. ""That would be empowering for members of the community because it would involve acceptance of the fact that transgenders are part of society and bring them into the mainstream, apart from giving them a livelihood,"" he says.
  ,
  ,
  But the discrimination that transgenders face leaves them with little optimism that they could win acceptance and integrate with society. ""Social acceptance? I don't know if that is possible,"" says transgender Raji Sekar, 25. ""We can't even take a house on rent because few landlords would want transgenders as tenants.""
  ,
  ,
  ""I did not wish to be transgender,"" she says. ""I was born this way and that is what people should realise for society to accept us,"" she says.
  ,
  ,
  Her companion Ambika M, has bruises on her face and hands. She says a group of men beat her up a few days ago. ""We face intolerance all the time, so nobody cares about our safety,"" she says. ""Not a day goes by without a transgender being beaten up by customers or drunkards.""

"Updated: Aug 9, 2014, 17:39 IST",HIV positive patients made to run in circles,"

  PATNA: A National , Control Organistion (NACO) ad has caught attention of many: A five-year-old's HIV positive mom is lying unattended at a hospital. The boy rushes to the doctor's chamber, takes his coat and runs back. The doctor and nurse rush behind him. Back with mom, the child says he resorted to the ?theft' just to bring his mother's case to the doctor's notice.
  
  ,
  Has the message percolated down to the doctors? Apparently not. A 45-year old HIV+ woman died at the PMCH after being denied surgery to remove intestinal obstruction in September last year. Amid much hue and cry, the state health department promised a slew of reforms to ensure people with HIV were not denied healthcare for their other ailments, but they seem to have remained on paper. Even the Patna high court's prods in this regard have gone in vain.
  ,
  ,
  Had it not been so, 45-yr-old Ram Kumar would not have been made to run from pillar to post ? from IGIMS to NMCH to PMCH, to be precise ? to get his urethra dilated. More than ten visits to these government healthcare facilities notwithstanding, Kumar remains untreated.
  ,
  ,
  It was on August 4, 2009 that Kumar visited the IGIMS' urology department for the first time. Investigations were conducted on him. ""However, when it was discovered that I am HIV positive, I was told to go away. As my condition deteriorated, I visited the hospital again after four days. They again said it was not possible to operate me at the IGIMS,"" he said.
  ,
  ,
  As the complications increased, Kumar visited a private doctor. He prescribed treatment for a year but the surgery became a must. Kumar went to the NMCH in December 2013. He was refused surgery there too and was instead ""referred to PMCH/IGIMS.""
  ,
  ,
  To try his luck for the third time, the patient went to the IGIMS again and found history repeating itself. ""The machine through which the operation is done is not functional,"" Kumar quoted the same doctor as telling him this time.
  ,
  ,
  In July this year, Kumar went to the PMCH which referred him to the IGIMS. ""I have lost all hopes. The private doctor says it is high time I got operated upon. If I die, who will be responsible for my death?"" Kumar asked TOI on Friday.
  ,
  ,
  The doctors Kumar visited have written ""HIV+"" in bold letters on the top on his prescriptions despite the fact that the treatment protocol prohibits such ?announcements'. All that the doctors can write on such prescriptions is ?PLWHA' which stands for people living with HIV/AIDS.
  ,
  ,
  Kumar's is not a one-off case. Raja Singh of Chhoti Pahaari at Patna has been endlessly waiting for a heart surgery. He even visited a private hospital where the doctors told him he should go to the PMCH since his was an HIV case. He has made several rounds of the PMCH's , since then. Intermittently, he was referred to AIIMS, Safdarjung Hospital and G B Pant Hospital (all in Delhi).
  ,
  ,
  Gyan Ranjan, a social activist who has been taking cudgels on behalf of the people with HIV, says he gets 30 to 40 calls from such patients every week. They are denied surgeries ranging from uterus removal to orthopaedic restoration. A patient was denied endoscopy at PMCH last year, he said.
  ,
  ,
  According to Ranjan, doctors at times frighten away the patients by cooking up stories. ""Two months back, a 40-yr-old woman of Chhapra went to the PMCH to get her stone problem treated. Doctors told her she would die on the operation table and she returned without treatment. Such cases are common in orthopaedic department too,"" Ranjan said.
  ,
  ,
  ""After the death of a woman last year, the , promised it would allot an operation theatre for two days a week for surgery of people living with HIV. That promise has gone in vain. Doctors say they are not being provided safety kits while their hospitals deny this claim. The responsibility has not been fixed and, as such, the vicious cycle of denial goes on,"" Ranjan said.

  WASHINGTON: Researchers have developed a dissolvable tampon-like product that can carry substantial loads of medicine and could offer fast-acting HIV protection.
  
  ,
  Researchers at the University of Washington (UW) have developed the material which is capable of carrying substantial loads of medicine, dissolving and releasing the drugs once its comes into contact with moisture.
  ,
  ,
  The study builds on research conducted at UW's Department of Bioengineering in 2012.
  ,
  ,
  Dr Kim Woodrow and her team were experimenting with electrospinning, a process where a charged fluid containing polymers and antiretroviral drugs is projected from a syringe and through an electric field.
  ,
  ,
  The electric field causes the jet of liquid to break into tiny fibres, each measuring anywhere between 100 to several thousand nanometres, 'Gizmag' reported.
  ,
  ,
  These then come to land on a collecting plate and combine to form a stretchy fabric capable of blocking sperm and, as the researchers discovered, carrying and releasing contraceptives and antivirals.
  ,
  ,
  Because certain elements of the material can be controlled, such as the solubility, strength and size of the fibres, the researchers said that it may prove more versatile than other anti-HIV technologies currently in development.
  ,
  ,
  One sample dissolved within minutes, an application that could protect against unwanted pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases.
  ,
  ,
  Another sample dissolved over several days, which could prove useful in sustained delivery of drugs, such as birth-control pills and anti-HIV medicines.
  ,
  ,
  The team said that the electrospun material can carry a large load of maraviroc, an antiretroviral drug used in the treatment of HIV which has minimal side effects.

  HYDERABAD: Undivided Andhra Pradesh reported the highest number of pregnant mothers testing positive for HIV in 2013.
  
  ,
  According to recent data from the , and family welfare, 1,330 pregnant women of the nearly seven lakh carrying mothers screened in AP last year, tested HIV positive. The ministry data shows that in neighbouring states like Maharashtra and Karnataka, where a larger number of women were screened, the percentage of women testing positive was significantly lower. It has been estimated that a mother has 30 per cent chance of transmitting the virus to her baby during pregnancy. The mortality rate among children with HIV is much higher compared to adults owing to their under-developed immune systems.
  ,
  ,
  However AP fared better or equally well in treating mothers to prevent transmission to children, as evinced by the data which shows that 1,142 HIV positive pregnant women were put on treatment.
  ,
  ,
  To reduce the numbers of baby transmissions, AP government in a first launched a new regimen of medication and treatment modality in 2012. The new treatment modality requires mothers to start treatment 14 weeks into pregnancy as against earlier practice of taking medication at the time of delivery. The medication now comprises a combination of three drugs as against one compound that was given earlier. Babies now are also given the same medication after birth. Additionally, under the new treatment practice, babies are screened every six months after birth until 18 months of age, when a concluding diagnosis is made about their infection.
  ,
  ,
  According to P L Jayachandra Reddy, additional project director of AP State Aids Control Society, more than 90 per cent of the first batch of pregnant women in undivided AP, who were put on the new treatment modality in 2012, delivered babies without infecting them.
  ,
  ,
  ""The transmission rate has come down to about five per cent. It has not been eliminated completely owing to drug resistance some of the women developed during treatment or due to delay in starting the treatment,"" Reddy said.
  ,
  ,
  A team comprising members of World Health Organisation (WHO) and National Aids Control Organisation (NACO) established this during a study of AP's implementation of the new treatment modality in March this year, 18 months after the first batch of women mentioned by Reddy, gave birth. Buoyed by AP's success, the WHO-NACO team has recommended that the new treatment modality be taken up in other states.

"Updated: Aug 26, 2014, 05:32 IST,The treatment and control of HIV, including dispensing drugs and testing, is handled by the government-run pub... ",Stock-out hits HIV treatment across India,"

  MUMBAI: Treatment for , across India has taken a hit, especially in Delhi and Mumbai, due to severe stock-outs of , reported at government-owned centres.
  
  ,
  Shortage of first-line (initial), second-line (advanced) and paediatric HIV drugs, besides crucial diagnostic kits, has prompted patient groups to send a legal notice to the government, pointing to the scarcity, gaps in procurement and supply of these drugs.
  ,
  ,
  The treatment and control of HIV, including dispensing drugs and testing, is handled by the government-run public health programme through its 355-odd centres.
  ,
  ,
  Of the over two million HIV-infected people in India, four states — Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu — account for 53%. More than one-third of them, or 7.5 lakh patients, are on the public health programme this year. While the medicines are available in the retail market at a cost, the ones dispensed at government-owned centres come free.
  ,
  ,
  At certain centres in Mumbai and Delhi, partial doses of treatment are being provided to patients for a few days, forcing them to return frequently. Alternatively, drugs are being substituted.
  ,
  ,
  Hospitals such as AIIMS, Safdarjung and LNJP in Delhi, and Nair, KEM, Siddharth and Sion in Mumbai have been grappling with shortage of these drugs.
  ,
  ,
  ,
  ,
  ,
  Prices of first-line HIV drugs in the retail market has come down now substantially due to affordable generic medicines. The treatment costs lakhs of rupees for advanced therapies for certain patients. While, retail first-line drugs cost Rs 5,500 a year, the advanced and complex therapies come at around Rs 20,000 to Rs 2 lakh a year.
  ,
  ,
  In a legal notice to the health ministry sent on August 22, the Delhi Network of Positive People (DNP+), representing HIV patients, has sought emergency procurement and relocation of stocks to government-owned centres experiencing stock-outs of ARVS, particularly in Mumbai. They have also sought strengthening and streamlining drug forecasting, procurement and supply chain mechanism to prevent future shortages.
  ,
  ,
  Stock-outs have hit centres in Delhi, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Karnataka and Manipur the worst, Vikas Ahuja of International Treatment Preparedness Coalition, South Asia, told TOI. Drug supply has been erratic over the past few months, Ahuja said.
  ,
  ,
  Bureaucratic delay in tendering, procurement and supply has been cited as the reason, besides the mechanism not being planned proactively and in a streamlined way.
  ,
  ,
  As per NACO guidelines, patients adhering to the treatment should get the medicines for at least a month.
  ,
  ,
  Industry experts say shortage of second-line therapy has existed in certain centres since 2012, and that of diagnostic kits since last year.

"Updated: Aug 26, 2014, 03:29 IST",Faulty HIV test on pregnant woman at Civil Hospital,"

  GURGAON: An , test at , during the initial trimester of her pregnancy was negative. So, the hospital provided her regular care and medicines. Now, weeks before the delivery date, she is in fear that the mistake by the hospital may end up affecting the baby she is expecting.
  
  ,
  Along with her husband, Asha (name changed), a Gurgaon resident from a semi-rural background, was detected HIV positive in 2011 by Civil Hospital. This year, the couple decided to have a child. After conceiving, in March, Asha visited Civil Hospital again. The hospital again put her through an HIV test, which is mandatory under Haryana government rules on all pregnant women. The 2011 report fell between the cracks.
  ,
  ,
  But this new report a copy of which is with TOI showed she was HIV negative. Asha proceeded to follow doctors' instructions, assuming they were aware of her HIV positive condition as those tests had been conducted in the same hospital, without noticing that this time, the results were different.
  ,
  ,
  Earlier this month, when she visited a , at Civil Hospital for a check-up, Asha told her she was HIV positive. The gynaecologist immediately got another test done at the hospital. This time, the result was positive. The lab staff made a new report on August 19. The hospital, subsequently, referred the case to a Delhi hospital. ""We'll first have to figure out why she was referred to a new hospital. We're carrying out investigations. Action will be taken if lab reports were found to be false,"" said CMO Pushpa Bishnoi.
  ,
  ,
  Asked about the impact of the faulty report on the baby, a city-based gynecologist said, ""Although it depends on the viral load in her body, since in this case both husband and wife are infected, she (Asha) should have been given anti-virus therapy from the beginning.""

"Ravi Sharma,Updated: Aug 26, 2014, 01.26PM IST",Review: Xolo 8X-1000 smartphone and HIVE UI,"NEW DELHI: Indian smartphone makers are a dominant force, accounting for a majority of sales in the country’s booming market. Their formula has been simple: Offer the most basic version of Android (often an old build) and package it in a device with susceptible build quality and big screen.
, 
, However, smartphone maker , is breaking away from this ‘tradition’ and is now offering a big-screen smartphone made of glass and plastic and comes with a proprietary Android skin, a first for an Indian company.
, 
, So how does Xolo’s first attempt at creating a customized user interface work out? Does it hamper the user experience of the phone or does it help it work better? We find out in our , review…
, 
, 
,
, 
, 
,
, 
, Xolo has gone for the unibody design for its 8X-1000 smartphone, so the microSD and the two sim card slots are accessible from the sides. The front and back are made from glass, while the sides are made of quality plastic, so the smartphone feels solid and rather light. The Xolo branding is in the front as well as on the back.
, 
,
, 
, There are no hardware keys below the display, with the Home, Back and Options keys designed as touch-sensitive, backlit dots. The speakers are at the bottom edge, so it is unlikely for them to get muffled. Both the microUSB port and earphone jack are on the top edge. The glass on the back panel is protected by Gorilla Glass 3.
, 
, The 5-inch HD display, layered with Dragontrail glass, takes up most of the space on the front. It is a pretty good display panel, offering good sunlight legibility and viewing angles. It can also easily change from warm to cold tones when the themes are changed. In fact, the display of Xolo 8X-1000 easily finds a place among the best screens we have seen recently in the sub-Rs 15,000 range.
, 
, 
,
, Xolo 8X-1000 packs a 1.4GHz octa-core processor by Mediatek and 2GB RAM under the hood. It has 16GB in-built storage and supports microSD cards with capacities up to 32GB. You can access the internet via 2G, 3G and Wi-Fi, while data can be transferred using Bluetooth 4.0 and microUSB 2.0. On the back is an 8MP rear camera with LED flash and a 2MP camera is in front. This phone is powered by a non-removable 1,920mAh Li-ion battery.
, 
, 
,
, Xolo 8X-1000 is the launch vehicle for the company’s new proprietary Android user interface, named HIVE. Much like Xiaomi's MIUI, Asus's Zen and HTC's Sense, Xolo's HIVE UI is a launcher that adds a number of functions to the core Android 4.4 (KitKat) software, redesigns app icons and offers various effects that together give more control over the look and feel of the software of the phone.
, 
, The most important custom app in HIVE UI is Edge, where you can download themes, wallpapers and ringtones. At present, it has only three themes, and one theme (named Calli-Cool) caught our eye. It offers a glimpse into the potential of HIVE UI as a platform for designers.
, 
, Designed by a National School of Design graduate, this theme centres on calligraphy. This is evident straight from the lock screen, where you have to trace a character to perform specific actions (you need to trace ‘U’ to unlock, ‘C’ to go straight to the dialer or ‘M’ to open the
, messaging app).
, 
, In this theme, as well as in the remaining two, you cannot choose which functions you want on the lock screen; for example, you cannot open WhatsApp from the lock screen, something that I can do with Asus's Zen UI.
, 
, HIVE UI has an app called Connect, where users can connect with each other, share ideas, post suggestions etc for Xolo developers. It also gives a list of service centres around your location and lets you check for software updates.
, 
, The phone also comes with a proprietary power management app that lets you see, and control to an extent, the apps that hog resources. Another custom app by Xolo is Fusion music player, which remains much the same.
, 
, 
,
, 
, All custom apps feature a drop-down menu that is characterized by sharp lines, and does not merge well with the themes that HIVE UI offers. This drop-down menu is not a HIVE feature and has been part of earlier Xolo apps, such as Fusion. Therefore, Xolo may have to alter the design of this menu to make it look more a part of the theme than its own UI.
, 
, There are some elements of the UI (not the themes) that we would like to have more control over. For example, the Quick Settings menu in Notifications shows the option to change the screen timeout period. Not many people we showed this feature to found it useful as this is something hardly anyone bothers about after setting it once. Similarly, we would like to have the choice to put a few icons on the lock screen for easier access.
, 
, 
,
, Xolo 8X-1000 seems like a potent smartphone due to the combo of octa-processor and 2GB RAM. However, this does not translate to a snappy performer in real-world usage. The phone is not slow, but it is not as fast as we would like it to be either.
, 
, Lag is apparent if you perform too many actions in quick succession. Memory management is when themes are active is also a problem, as even commonly used apps like WhatsApp and Facebook crashed on more than one occasion due to ‘out of memory’ error. Now, these are common occurrences on low-end phones, but not something we would expect from a phone that has 2GB of memory to offer.
, 
, Battery life of the phone is okay, lasting around 10 hours if you have an active 3G or Wi-Fi connection all the time. Moderate usage can help the phone last nearly 24 hours before you need to plug it in for charging again.
, 
, Xolo 8X-1000 plays multimedia content well, and watching videos on the phone is a pleasant experience. However, its speaker output is not very loud, and you would struggle to enjoy music or videos unless you use earphones.
, 
, 
,
, 
, 
,
, 
, The 8MP camera of Xolo 8X-1000 is quite good for the price. You can pick between different filters – such as sepia, dark and white – and the usual shooting modes, such as Auto, Pro, HDR and Panorama. Its Gesture Mode, where the phone detects bunny ears to take the photo, is a hit and miss feature and does not always work.
, 
, 
,
, 
, Photos taken using Xolo 8X-1000's 8MP camera under daylight deliver images with accurate colours and good white balance. Even photos taken in the dark look nice but a bit oversaturated, with a little less noise than we are used to with cameras in this price range.
, 
, 
,
, 
, 
,
, Gaming on Xolo 8X-1000 is a decent experience. You can, quite obviously, play the likes of Subway Surfer and Temple Run with ease. However, there was just a little stutter when we tried our hand at Real Racing 3 and Injustice: Gods Among Us. Nevertheless, both these graphics-intensive games were playable most of the time, with the HD screen rendering the graphics pretty nicely.
, 
, 
,
, Xolo 8X-1000 is a decent smartphone that tries to distinguish itself from the crowd with the help of its new HIVE UI. In this attempt, it is successful to an extent, but the hardware and software do not complement each other as well as potential buyers would like them to. Memory management is a concern as a device with 2GB RAM should not ideally hang.
, 
, Camera and display are the two best features of Xolo 8X-1000 and are easily among the best in their range, barring the Full HD touting Xiaomi Mi 3. HIVE UI is pleasing to the eye and shows potential, so we would wait for it to get better and add more features in the future.
, 
, However, we would still go with Xiaomi Mi 3 or Asus Zenfone 5 if we want to spend Rs 13,999.

  GHOLA: The , couple, who was thrown out of their home here on Saturday, are yet to come out of the trauma that they had to undergo.
  
  ,
  A routine blood test during the pregnancy of Ruma (name changed) in 2007 revealed that she was HIV-positive. Shortly afterwards, her husband Binoy (name changed) also tested HIV-positive. Ever since, Binoy's brother threatened the duo of dire consequences every now and then if they did not leave the house they shared with him.
  ,
  ,
  ""My brother in-law used to abuse me maligning my character. For the last few years, I have not even shared the common washroom,"" she said.
  ,
  ,
  ""No amount of reasoning would convince him that we were taking all the necessary precautions since we also have a child. He and his wife would abuse and even physically assault us. Finally, on Saturday afternoon, my brother-in-law summoned a few locals who are known to him. After my husband returned from work, they caught hold of him and threw him out of the house. When I rushed to his rescue, one of them hit me on the head with a stick and I started bleeding,"" she added.
  ,
  ,
  ""But nobody in our locality was aware of our disease until yesterday. I am afraid how I will run my family now. I don't know how our daughter will continue her education either.""
  ,
  ,
  The battered couple went to police, who helped them return home. There is now a police picket in the locality in Ghola. But the stigma of social ostracism in an area barely 30km from the city centre is a grim pointer to the , that still surrounds the disease.
  ,
  ,
  The couple have a six-year-old daughter, who is not HIV-positive. They were making preparations to secure her life when their own blood relatives and one-time friends turned on them. On Sunday, the couple brought back their daughter from an undisclosed location where they had sent her fearing her safety when they were attacked on Saturday.

  ,
  Local residents, however, came to the rescue of the couple. Basanti Malo, a member of ,, said: ""The shame will be on us and not them if we cannot stand by them at their hour of crisis. We plan to hand over some money to the couple by saving it from our Puja funds.""
  ,
  ,
  Pappu Roy, a local resident and a third-year student at APC College, said: ""I will discuss with my friends how we can stand by them. We will have to first raise their confidence level so that they can live in the mainstream of the society without any sense of shame and fear. However, the question of how they will run their family and manage treatment costs is of utmost importance.""
  ,
  ,
  ""The couple says they are HIV-positive and that they were beaten up by the husband's brother. We have taken down their complaint. We will take strong action against the accused,"" said Barrackpore detective chief C Sudhakar.
  ,
  ,
  When a police contingent accompanied the couple back to their house, the accused were nowhere to be found. After ensuring that the couple was safely in their house, police left a stern message with locals not to bother them in the future.

Following nevarapine oral suspension, a preventive medicine against transmission from HIV positive mother to a new born, which is out of stock, pregnant mothers are a worried lot. , The medicine is not available either in the market or government run Anti Retroviral Therapy (ART) medicine. The situation started in March at Tarn Taran when a baby could not be saved from being HIV due to the absence of another medicine, Zidovudine.

""And the same conditions continues to prevail,"" said Tarseem Singh, president of Umeed , an NGO in Amritsar that has been working for the cause. , The NGO has written several letters to the officials at the Punjab state Aids Control Society, but in vain.

  ""HIV prevalence varied depending upon type of sex work. Higher prevalence of 3.25% has been found among brothel-based sex workers followed by 1.4% among street-based and 0.48% in home-based sex workers,"" according to the report.
  ,
  ,
  The report elaborates that HIV prevalence varies among female sex workers (FSW) on the time they had spent in the work. ""Considering the duration of sex work, highest positivity has been recorded among those who are in the profession of sex work for around 3 to 5 years. During the HIV Sentinel Surveillance (HSS) 2008, the highest positivity of 6.25% was seen among new entrants (i.e. six months to one year of sex work). In HSS 2010-11, among new entrants, the HIV prevalence is only 1.67% which is reduced by 5.58% as compared to HSS 2008,"" the report says.

  The HIV positivity among sex workers with one to six years in the profession is 1.67%, among those with one to 3 years is 0.38%, those with 3-5 years have highest prevalence of 2.39% and with more than 5 years in profession, such workers have 1.36% of prevalence.

  RSACS officials claimed that the HIV prevalence among sex workers have declined over the past few years. ""Result of the HSS 2010-11 shows that the overall HIV prevalence amongst female sex workers is 1.28%, a significant decrease of 2.53% from 2008. Three consistent sites Ajmer, Alwar and Banswara showed significant decrease in prevalence,"" the report says.

  The result of HSS 2010-11 shows that highest HIV prevalence rates among FSWs have been recorded in eastern and southern parts of the state.

  ""Nearly one out of 20 female sex workers are living with HIV in Alwar, while Udaipur and Ajmer have almost one out 100 sex workers with HIV, Ganganagar has one out of 200 sex workers with HIV,"" the report says.
  ,
  ,
  Alwar has higher prevalence as the work is brothel based. An RSACS official said the prevalence among the sex workers is on the decline because they are more aware of precautions and also the officials are conducting individual tracking to prevent HIV infections among FSWs.
  ,
  ,
  While comparing prevalence between rural and urban areas, it has been found in HSS 2010 data that prevalence rate is higher in rural areas (1.95%) as compared to urban areas (0.57%).
  ,
  ,
  ""A scrutiny of higher vulnerability to HIV rendering to the characteristics of the population marks that women who have certain education are more informed, and thus better able to protect themselves from HIV. This was observed in HSS 2010 data where educated female sex workers comprised a lower proportion (1.01%) of the total number of HIV positive than their illiterate counterparts,"" the report says.
  ,
  ,
  Moreover, the positivity is on the decline among young female sex workers aged 20-29 years. It was 4.24% in 2008 compared to 1.78% in 2010-2011, a decline of 2.46%.

  MUMBAI: In a move that will disappoint many patients, the government has withdrawn certain powers of the drug pricing regulator that allowed it to cap prices of widely prescribed anti-diabetes, cancer, HIV, tuberculosis and cardiac medicines.
  
  ,
  The , (NPPA) said it is withdrawing ""with immediate effect"" — a guideline that had allowed it to put price caps on crucial medicines — to comply with a government ""direction"". The guideline had been issued on May 29, just three days after the Modi government was sworn in.
  ,
  ,
  Although the NPPA's sudden notification does not mention whether it is revoking the price caps which it had announced on 50 anti-diabetic and cardiac drugs in July, the development could have negative fallout, sources said. A wider and more serious impact will be that impending price controls on expensive treatments of cancer, HIV and tuberculosis now stand cancelled.
  ,
  ,
  ,
  ,
  ,
  NPPA officials were not available for comment, but sources say the government succumbed to pressure from industry lobbies. The NPPA's decision to impose price controls had been hotly contested; with the industry up in arms against what it said was ""arbitrary implementation of the policy"".
  ,
  ,
  In effect, NPPA has withdrawn guidelines for price control issued under Para 19 of the Drug Prices Control Order (DPCO) 2013, which authorized it to control prices of drugs that are not under the NLEM (National List of Essential Medicines) under ""extraordinary circumstances"" and in ""public interest"".
  ,
  ,
  ,
  ,
  ,
  In July the NPPA, in a rare invocation of the lesser-used provision, had fixed prices of 50 anti-diabetic and cardiovascular medicines. This was the first time the government had brought drugs, outside the national list of essential medicines, under price control. (Prices of 652 drugs under NLEM were fixed by the government last year under DPCO 2013).
  ,
  ,
  The move had triggered of a series of protests and lawsuits from the industry against the drug pricing regulator as they feared more such action.
  ,
  ,
  ""In compliance with the directions received from the government in the department of pharmaceuticals ... The aforesaid internal guidelines issued by the NPPA on May 29, 2014 under Paragraph 19 of DPCO 2013 are hereby withdrawn with immediate effect,"" NPPA said in its latest notification posted on its website.
  ,
  ,
  The industry welcomed the move saying that the interpretation of the May guidelines was erroneous.
  ,
  ,
  ""We have always contended that the guidelines for Para 19 were erroneous. Para 19 is not the right provision for extension of price control as there is no public health concern which could have prompted the NPPA to invoke the provision,"" D G Shah, secretary general of Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance, said.
  ,
  ,
  ,
  ,
  ,
  Though it is still trying to figure out its implication on companies, the industry body representing multinational firms, the Organisation of Pharmaceutical Producers of India, said: ""We appreciate the government's decision to withdraw the guidelines on fixation/revision of prices of scheduled and non-scheduled formulations under Para 19 of the DPCO 2013. This welcome move tells us we are being heard and we look forward to working with the government toward a common goal.""

  Panaji: Though statistics provided by the Goa state AIDS control society (GSACS) depict a gradual decline in the number of HIV and AIDS cases in Goa over the last five years, GSACS has stepped up its efforts to reduce the number , cases in the state even further.
  
  ,
  Last year, 532 cases of HIV were registered in the state compared to 959 cases in 2009. A similar trend has been observed among AIDS patients with only 51 cases registered in 2013 compared to 184 cases registered in 2009. A total of 1,040 persons have succumbed to the deadly virus since 1989, when HIV was first detected in Goa. But, this is only the reported figure, while the actual number would be higher as HIV-related deaths at home or private hospitals are not reflected in the above figures.
  ,
  ,
   , Dr , said that they have increased the number of anti-retroviral treatment (ART) centres in Goa. Earlier, there was only one main ART centre at the Goa medical college, Bambolim; but, in recent years, GSACS has set up link ART centres at Asilo hospital, Mapusa, Hospicio hospital, Margao, sub-district hospital, Ponda and cottage hospital, Chicalim.
  ,
  ,
  Patankar revealed plans of upgrading the link ART centre at the Hospicio, Margao, to facility-integrated ART centre. This means that there will be a doctor and nurse at the centre and patients from South Goa need not travel to GMC for the initial CD4 test. He also mentioned of another link ART centre that has been approved for the Curchorem community health centre.
  ,
  ,
  GSACS has tied up with nine NGOs to execute 16 projects in Goa to combat HIV/AIDS. These NGOs work with high risk groups like commercial sex workers, drug users, gay men, truckers, etc. GSACS is now adding two more projects with the focus on migrants.
  ,
  ,
  Another new measure is towards HIV positive pregnant women. Earlier, these , were treated only at the time of delivery. Now, such cases will be provided life-long ART treatment and the child will be given treatment for at least six months depending on whether it is HIV positive or negative. ""Presently, the mother to child HIV transmission percentage is about 2.5%. We want to make it zero,"" Patankar said.
  ,
  ,
  He also informed of another new initiative of setting up a new opiad substitution therapy centre at Hospicio, Margao. This centre is meant to wean drug addicts who use injections from syringes to oral drugs which are less addictive. Presently, there is only one such centre at Calangute which is run by an NGO.
  ,
  ,
  GSACS is also adding one more ICTC (integrated counselling and testing centres) at Ponda. It already has 14 such centres all over Goa including three especially for expectant mothers. , AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) has sanctioned 7.55 crore for GSACS to conduct its programmes this year, but the amount is yet to be released, Patankar added.

  The love and care they now thrive on comes from the nuns of the ,. Three nuns manage ASRO - the home for HIV positive children - which is a project of ,.
  ,

  The home began with one HIV positive child in a residential house at Canca, Tivim, in 2002. That child died four years ago, the home is now a big building closer to Acoi and presently, there are 20 girls and 22 boys living there. Except for seven, all are on anti-retroviral treatment from the Goa medical college. Most of the children are migrants but there are a few Goans from the Vasco area. ASRO takes in children of all creeds and most are non-Christians, except five.
  ,
  ,
  ""There is a sad story behind every child here,"" says Sr Coshav Rodrigues, in-charge of the home. ""It is not their fault that they are HIV positive. Almost all of them got it from their parents.""
  ,
  ,
  But forget society, even family can be unforgiving. There is one 14-year-old girl from a well-to-do family, who lost both her parents to HIV/AIDS. When other family members realized she too was positive, they admitted her to ASRO. Once they took her home on a festival day but would not allow their daughter to play with her. When they returned the child to ASRO later in the evening, the child was in tears. And resolutely silent. With Sr Coshav's gentle probing, the child opened up. The nun later counselled the family which relented and now take the child home for three or four days sometimes. ""There is lot of misinformation among people. But they realize there is no danger when we tell them that we live with these children 24-hours in a day. We want to integrate them in society but the children live with rejection. Some express their hurt,"" says Sr Felcy Lewis, who is also the resident nurse at the home.

  The oldest boy is 22-years old. He was admitted when he was around nine. He could not cope with studies and now works at the home. Except for the occasional cold, cough and fever, he keeps fairly good health. The youngest child is four years old who was admitted in June this year. She too is quite healthy. All children are taken for health check-ups to the GMC every month. But every six months, the children undergo blood tests at the GMC. In the last four years, only one child died at the home.
  ,
  ,
  Though the project is run by Caritas Goa, people donate generously in kind by giving rice, dal, coconut, sugar, milk, biscuits and bakery products. Occasionally, the home also gets chicken and fish.
  ,
  ,
  Waking up in the middle of the night to tend to a sick child is routine for the three nuns. But the boys and girls living under the same roof though in different quarters, are growing up. Naturally, there is the occasional display of affection. The nuns have to now cope with the possibility of the blossoming of love between the children. It's a challenge they are seeking to address the only way they know, with love.

  Guwahati: About 63,049 HIV infected people in the northeast are facing acute shortage and depletion of anti-retroviral therapy (ART) drugs. The slack supply could lead to there being no stocks left which could make HIV positive people very vulnerable to anti-retroviral therapy (ART) drug resistance as well, according to activists working with HIV positive people.

The scheme has so far enrolled 1,726 infected adults and children,14 orphan children who lost their parents to HIV/AIDS, 26 orphaned HIV-positive children and 12 HIV-positive destitute children. , A sum of Rs 1,000 is given as monthly benefit to PLHAs including infected children, Rs 1,750 to orphaned children who are not positive but affected by HIV/AIDS as their parents were infected with the virus and Rs 2,050 to orphans and destitute children infected by HIV/AIDS under the scheme. , However, the DCPCR study says there is need to reach out to more children. It is stated that the eligibility criteria are too complex for an affected person to fulfill. According to these, a PLHA has to be on one year of Anti Retroviral Treatment and has to provide proof of the same. Besides being a resident of Delhi for three years, the beneficiary must have an annual family income of less than Rs 1 lakh. In case of orphaned children there has to be proof of death of one or both parents due to HIV/AIDS. In case of a destitute child, proof of HIV positive status is mandatory. The child must also be found living in an institution in Delhi.

The question of his having knowledge that by this act he was likely to spread infection of a disease dangerous to life didn't arise,"" Justice Kaur said while quashing the FIR lodged in Vasant Vihar police station., , According to the police, Birender, a shopkeeper, sodomized a boy by closing the doors of his shop and luring the boy in on the pretext of offering him money. Later, the father of the victim lodged a complaint on the basis of the boy's allegations of unnatural sex., , Appearing for Birender, advocate Vijay Aggarwal pointed out that medical records clearly show his client never committed the offence of unnatural sex and he can't be held guilty for the offence dealing with spreading of infection because it is implicit that no sexual act took place between him and the alleged victim., , A magistrate who first heard the case found that the statements made by the victim and his father were contrary to the version given by the boy under section 164 CrPC. Though the magistrate acquitted Birender, a session's court refused to discharge him of the offence under Section 270 of IPC that deals with ""malignant act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life."", , The high court while hearing the revision plea focused on the medico legal case of the victim and found no mention of any external injury in anal region, no pain, no bleeding., , The court also pointed out that once an act itself never occurred as per evidence, the knowledge of the accused to spread infection of a dangerous disease by doing such an act can't be accepted as evidence in law.,  "

  CHENNAI : Homosexuals in the city have complained that they are being given overdoses of messages on HIV prevention and that programmes concerning the community should address their psychological needs more.
  
  ,
  A study conducted among MSMs (men who have sex with men) in the city revealed that most of the homosexuals wanted guidance on overcoming stress arising out of social stigma.
  ,
  ,
  About 55 gays, ranging from post-graduate students to sex workers, were interviewed in a study conducted by , (,) in collaboration with Sahodaran (an NGO for MSMs).
  ,
  ,
  Though the study says that gay men in India have an HIV seroprevalence rate that is 22 times higher than the country's general population, those surveyed have a different take. ""It is better not to keep concentrating on HIV... I think it is important to raise the low self-esteem of MSMs,"" one of the interviewees said.
  ,
  ,
  Those who participated in the survey showed a high degree of awareness of HIV prevention. Nevertheless, they expressed concerns surrounding their mental health. Some complained of high levels of depression which they said followed after they had disclosed their sexual orientation. Changed behaviour of their family members, ridicule from peers and a sense of social rejection, said the interviewees, have taken a toll on their self-esteem.
  ,
  ,
  The interviewees also pointed out lack of privacy in state-run STI clinics (health centres which deal with sexually transmitted diseases). Once their sexual identity is disclosed, the homosexuals often face discrimination and harassment. This, some stated, forced them into alcohol or substance abuse. As a remedy, most stated that they preferred individual counseling.
  ,
  ,
  ""When the society ridicules, having multiple partners becomes a desirable way to feel accepted. Unless they get help to come to terms and respect themselves, the sexual risk they face cannot be addressed. We have disseminated this study to NACO and few NGOs to carry out counseling,"" said scientist Beena Thomas, NIRT.

Instead, with one patch applied on their skin every week, such patients will be able to fight the dreadful disease! , A researcher at the Department of Pharmacy of M S University's Faculty of Technology and Engineering is developing formulations for transdermal delivery of an anti-HIV drug known as Lopinavir., , The research project, which started in 2010 with Rs 10.5 lakh fund allotted by the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE), is aimed at developing formulations which can deliver the anti-HIV drug through skin., , At present, the anti-HIV drug formulations are in the oral tablet form. The research is aimed at making the drug more effective., , ""Consumed in the oral form - tablets - the drug goes to liver and then to blood, where it acts against the virus. However, almost 80 per cent of this drug gets destroyed in liver by the enzymes and only 20 per cent of it reaches the blood and other organs of the body where it is actually needed,"" Dr Hetal Thakkar, who in course of the project has studied the transdermal drug delivery projects undertaken by the United States and United Kingdom-based reputed laboratories, told TOI., , ""If the drug can be delivered through skin, then it will directly reach the blood without encountering the liver and hence is saved from destruction. But skin is a tough protective barrier and hence delivery of drugs through skin is difficult,"" said Thakkar, adding that to overcome this limitation, the drug was entrapped in nanocarriers which can easily permeate through skin., , ""We have conducted studies on animals and we have got some promising results. When we compared the formulations developed by us with the oral formulations on rats, we found that there is nearly three times higher blood concentration which means we can also reduce the dosage of anti-HIV drug. Now, we will apply for clinical trials,"" said Thakkar., , According to Thakkar, reduction in dosage of the drug will also help reduce the side effects of the drug like nausea, vomiting and gastrointestinal disturbances which HIV/AIDS patients complain about during treatment., , ""If the side-effects can be reduced, the overall quality of life of the patients will improve and help in building of a healthy society.

  INDORE: After ,, which is a major contributor of , spread in the general population in Madhya Pradesh, use of , and needles is the secondhighest contributor for deadly virus spread.
  
  In HIV transmission, where safety is the only prevention, unsafe use of syringes/needles or unconscious prick is making people fall prey to the virus. Accidental or unsafe needle prick in past six years has spread the deadly virus in nearly 1,200 people in Madhya Pradesh. The figure is just an indication how fast the virus is spreading as only few reach to hospitals and are able to confirm the infection source.
  ,
  ,
  According to MP State AIDS Control Society (,), till October 2014, unsafe needle/syringe use has infected 115 people in state, which is expected to rise as year 2014-15 has yet four months to complete. Though there is no steep rise or decline in number of HIV positive patients in the state since 2008, every year over 100 people get infected due to unsafe needle/syringe prick.
  ,
  ,
  District Nodal Officer (AIDS), Dr Vijay Chajjlani said, ""Every year people get the virus in their body due to syringes/needles. Many of them do not even know that they have been infected. It comes as a shock for many, when medical investigations diagnose them HIV positive.

  PANAJI: Over the years, the rate of HIV infection has declined in Goa and some four-five new cases of HIV/AIDS are detected every month. But, what's bothering doctors and counsellors working with people living with HIV/AIDS is the casual attitude of the infected persons.
  
  ,
  Despite counselling, many don't take any precautions and pass on the infection to his/her partner. The ART (anti-retroviral therapy) center located in , (GMC) and hospital, Bambolim, receives many such cases.
  ,
  ,
  At the end of the day, the staff members find themselves exasperated when a new case of HIV is detected, and the source of infection is one of the patients taking treatment at the center. ""And we wonder whether we are doing any good to the society. We help them get well, and they go out and spread infection,"" said a ART staff member who recently dealt with a case of a 24-year-old man, who gave infection to his wife.
  ,
  ,
  When he walked in the center a year ago, he was thoroughly counselled
  ,
  along with his mother and told not to
  ,
  get married.
  ,
  ,
  ""Not only did he marry a HIV negative girl, but within a year had his 19-year-old wife infected, and now he wants to have a child too,"" said a ART member.
  ,
  ,
  ""I wanted somebody to take care of my son,"" was the
  ,
  mother's lame excuse when questioned about her son's marriage.
  ,
  ,
  The staff at the ART center has tried its best to dissuade him from having a child, but he is adamant. ""We have even told him that the baby may be born HIV positive. But you know, what he said? 'You people will cure him'. The staff member said she was infuriated when he heard him say that.

  ,
  A counsellor said, ""It's not that all don't listen, but then there's no way we can do anything other than telling them what they should and should not do.""

  Dr Vandana Patankar, project director, Goa state AIDS control society (GSACS), said this type of attitude is evident among HIV/AIDS patients as they want to prove to others that they are normal.

  MUMBAI: At a time when the , campaign is steering towards 'zero new infection', its prevention among high-risk groups in the city hangs between bad quality of , and complete unavailability of the same. Anti-HIV crusaders fear that substandard quality of free condoms alone can push up HIV prevalence.
  
  ,
  Over the last few months, cash-strapped NGOs and community-based organisations (CBO) have raised the issue of inferior quality condoms with government agencies.
  ,
  ,
  A Malad-based CBO has often written to National , Control Organisation (,), that inferior quality of condoms has rendered its distribution among transgenders useless. ""Our workers are ridiculed for distributing condoms, which lack proper lubrication,"" said Gauri Sawant of the CBO.
  ,
  ,
  Quality assumes importance in Mumbai which has nearly 2.50lakh people in the high-risk zone and vulnerable to contract the infection. ""Condom distribution is key to curbing infection among men having sex with men and female sex workers,"" said Ashok Row Kavi founder of Humsafar Trust. ""Super-lubricated condoms are not that useful. We must provide regular condoms with extra lubrication,"" he said.
  ,
  ,
  While NGOs are supposed to get 80% of condom supply from NACO, they are expected to forge ties with manufacturers to arrange for the remaining 20%. NGOs say due to payment issues they hardly manage to get private firms interested in supplying them.
  ,
  ,
  For NGOs working with female sex workers, it becomes a dual challenge. ""It takes a lot of persuasion for a sex worker to convince a client to use a condom. The least NACO can ensure is to provide good quality condoms,"" said a CBO working with female sex workers.
  ,

  NACO refused knowledge of quality concerns. ""There have been problems with supply, which will be streamlined soon. But we haven't been told of quality issues,"" said a senior official.

  VADODARA: While the prevalence of the HIV/AIDS infection has largely remained stagnant over the past three years, doctors believe there is still a long way to go before it actually shows a decline.
  
  ,
  A recent study conducted by Dr Yogesh Marfatia, head of SSG Hospital's department of skin and venereal diseases, shows that the major reason of the virus still being transmitted is its late detection in carriers.
  ,
  ,
  ""Awareness has reached a lot of people and the percentage increase has reduced comparatively in the last 15 years. Some regions in the country continue to record a large number of , cases, which is why the national average still shows a positive trend on a graph. Until the national average comes to stagnation, a reverse trend is almost impossible. The migration of citizens will continue to spread the infection,"" said Marfatia.
  ,
  ,
  According to Dr Mohammed Hussain, who handles HIV patients at SSG Hospital, transmission of the virus still continues at considerable rate. ""There still remains a section across the social strata of the population that do not go for regular check-ups. HIV virus can stay in the human body without causing any trouble for years, but the infection can be transmitted to another person,"" he added.
  ,
  ,
  The study conducted by Marfatia suggests that nearly 68 per cent of spouses get infected because the disease was never detected in their partners. "", intercourse is the commonest route of HIV transmission in India. The unaffected spouse could incur the infection for two basic reasons - either the infected person is unaware of the infection or the infected person deliberately hides the information,"" added Marfatia.
  ,
  ,
  Sixty-six HIV positive patients and their partners from in and around the city were studied during the research project. The study concluded showed that unprotected sex between spouses remains a major cause of HIV transmission.
  ,
  ,
  ""The transmission of HIV and , due to blood transfusion or reused syringe has gone down to almost zero per cent. Multiple sex partners and unprotected sex remains the major cause now. People have to understand that regular check-ups and discussing about AIDS can solve the problem to a great extent,"" Marfatia said.

On the advice of the shrink, his family then took him to a government ICTC (Integrated counselling and testing centre) for a HIV re-testing. This time, much to the relief of everyone, the man is found HIV negative. But it was only after enduring the trauma for a month.

There are also other types of test kits such as Quickcheck, Elisa, Western Blot Tests as prescribed by the World Health Organisation (WHO). However, most private centres furnish reports after conducting a single test (Tri Dot test), which is not foolproof and people end up being declared HIV positive when they are not. Such wrong diagnosis can lead to disastrous consequences,"" said Dr Kutikuppala Surya Rao, who specialises in HIV/AIDS.

  PATNA: The Centre and the state government have set the target of eliminating kala-azar, also known as Visceral Leishmaniasis (VL) in medical parlance, by 2015. However, a study conducted by Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF), an international NGO, says many a kala-azar patient are , positive, but are ignorant about it. Non-treatment of HIV weakens their immunity system, due to which even VL drugs do not show proper effect and are leading to relapse of VL. Incidentally, Bihar accounts for over 90% kala-azar (VL) cases in the world.
  
  ,
  The study published in an issue of an international journal, Clinical Infectious Diseases, says out of over 2,000 kala-azar patients screened in Hajipur, 117 were HIV positive. Only 68 of them had prior knowledge of it. The prevalence of VL-HIV was much higher in males (71.4%) than females (28.6%).
  ,
  ,
  It may be mentioned here that another study published in August 2014 in Public Library of Science (,) had said that estimated chances of VL relapse in HIV positive people was over 25% after three years of treatment of kala-azar. The mortality rate of VL-HIV cases are also high. Even after four years of treatment of VL, 30% HIV-VL patients could not survive. There are also a couple of studies to suggest that early initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) for HIV positive had bettered the results of VL treatment too.
  ,
  ,
  These figures should be alarming because, according to an estimate, over 3 lakh people have HIV/AIDS in Bihar. The PLOS study says that the risk of developing VL in HIV positive people is 100-2300 times higher compared to non-HIV people. It added, ""Screening for VL in HIV cases living in VL-endemic areas must also be encouraged.""
  ,
  ,
  Experts say HIV test must become a part of protocol to treat VL. National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) and the National Vector Borne , (NVBDCP) had been assigned the task of developing guidelines to this effect in the road map released to eliminate VL by the then Union health minister, Dr Harsh Vardhan. While the state government still awaits any such guidelines, state programme officer M P Sharma said, ""As of now, there is no plan to include HIV testing in the VL treatment protocol. At present, we are concentrating on the guidelines given by the Centre.""
  ,
  ,
  There is another issue of dosage of drugs. Recently, AmBisome (single dose treatment for VL) was launched in the state. However, experts say single dosage does not work well in HIV-VL patients. Dr Gaurab Mitra, who was one of the researchers of the study and works with MSF, told TOI, ""Instead of giving it in one dose, we divide it into six doses. We believe and recommend the same in government protocol too.""
  ,
  ,
  His argument also finds support in the study mentioned in PLOS. The study, in fact, suggested that the number of follow-ups be more for HIV-VL cases than the VL ones.

  After Tamil Nadu's 80,000-odd cases, Gujarat is listed with 40,121 cases. States such as Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, which are larger both in area and population, have not recorded many cases.

  ""The southern states have taken , and prevention very seriously in the last five years.

  ,
  ,
  Though the cumulative numbers are high in the south, the number of fresh cases being recorded every year has dropped significantly since 2010. According to the health ministry, the total number new cases has reduced almost 50% across the country in three years—from 3.1 lakh fresh cases in 2010-11 to 1.5 lakh cases in 2013-14. Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka also saw a sharp fall in the number of fresh cases reported every year.
  ,
  ,
  The drop in the number of fresh cases is due to the increasing awareness among the public, especially the risk-prone communities of sex workers, homosexuals and transgenders, said Bakthavatchalam A, deputy director of Association for Rural Mass India, a non-profit organization working in the health sector.

"Suraj P Kaisuvker,Dec 1, 2014, 02:00 IST",30% percent HIV patients in Goa are non-Goans: GSACS,"

  PONDA:
  ,
  With a large number of migrants pouring into Goa, the , epidemic is turning into a frightening reality as the state has registered about 30 percent cases of HIV infection among , including people from other states and foreigners. A cause for alarm is that though the number of HIV infections has decreased this year as compared to the last, the number of HIV patients has increased.
  
  ,
  From January to October this year, Goa registered 128 cases of non-Goans among the total 376 cases registered across the state. During the corresponding period of last year, the figure was 86 of the total 386 cases registered by October 2013.
  ,
  ,
  Though the disease surfaced in Goa in 1987 when a foreigner was detected HIV positive with the second case being of a non-Goan in 1988, Goa has so-far registered 15,603 HIV positive persons. While Goa has registered 1,662 full-blown , cases up to October, a total of 1,041 patients have lost their lives to AIDS by September this year, states data prepared by the , (GSACS).
  ,
  ,
  According to data gathered by GSACS, HIV infection is now prevalent in all parts of Goa. What is worrying is that in Goa, HIV is not confined to coastal belts, but has penetrated to other areas, too. The disease is no longer an urban phenomenon, but has spread to rural areas as well. The HIV prevalence is shifting its base from one taluka to other, every year.
  ,
  ,
  In 2013, the majority of the cases was reported in the four coastal talukas: Salcete (18.4%), Mormugao (12.8%) in south Goa district and Tiswadi (11.5%) and Bardez (14.9%) in north Goa district during 2013.
  ,
  ,
  But, by October 2014, Tiswadi in the north showed a marginal decrease with 5.3% prevalence, while Bardez in the same district has shown a rise of about 2.7% (16.2% in 2014). In South Goa, Salcete has shown a decline of 4.3%. The taluka has noted 14.1% prevalence as against 18.4% of last year and Mormugao a decline of 2.7%. Last year, HIV prevalence in this taluka was 12.8% which has decreased to 10.1% this year, GSACS statistic stated. Dr Vandana Patankar, project director, GSACS, claimed that a large floating population in Goa has contributed to the bulging figure of HIV-infected in the state.
  ,
  ,
  People migrating to Goa from other Indian states raises the figure. The state has noted a spread of the disease largely by the sexual mode. While the state has a thriving drug trade on its coastal belts, there were very less number of people found affected with passing on the needles used for injecting narcotic drugs, she admitted.
  ,
  ,
  ""Besides, most of the people from other Indian states come to Goa to get their blood sample checked as Goa has better facilities than other states,"" Patankar said.
  ,
  ,
  She also said that Goa has proper counseling, awareness-raising measures, accurate testing facilities across the state and anti-retroviral treatment (ART) center at Goa medical college and hospital, Bambolim. There are 3,476 people including 1,962 males, 1,327 females, 183 children below the age of 14 years and four transgenders have registered for the ART, statistics point out.

"Sushmi Dey,Updated: Dec 1, 2014, 05:02 IST","Medicines, test kit scarcity hits HIV therapy","

  NEW DELHI: Even as the world commemorates , on Monday to continue its fight against ,, many patients in India are struggling for their daily dose of medicine or for tests to monitor the status of the infection.
  
  ,
  India has managed to bring down new HIV cases over the past five to six years by bringing in more patients under treatment and promoting use of condoms, mainly among the vulnerable population such as sex workers, drug addicts and transgenders. However, inconsistency in supplies and frequent stock outs of lifesaving HIV medicines in government owned centres in major cities like Delhi, Mumbai and the northeast have the potential to put India back in the danger zone, experts warn.
  ,
  ,
  ""Once a patient starts the therapy, medicine needs to be taken daily with proper adherence, or else the drugs quickly lose their effectiveness. Once this happens, HIV patients have to switch to a second line of treatment which is five times more expensive than first-line drugs, adding an additional burden on our healthcare system,"" said Daisy David, advocacy officer, World Vision India.
  ,
  ,
  Moreover, there is also a severe dearth of testing kits like CD4 and viral load, which are crucial for patients to monitor the virus and ascertain the stage of infection. ""These tests are important because they help a doctor ascertain when to change the line of treatment for particular patients. In the absence of these tests, a patient may develop resistance to a certain medicine or line of treatment and hence develop the virus again,"" said Vikas Ahuja, president of Delhi Network of Positive People, a trust that works with HIV/AIDS patients.
  ,
  ,
  A , (,) report last year said the Indian government was providing free anti-retroviral drugs for treating HIV since 2004, but only 50% of those eligible were getting it in 2012.
  ,
  ,
  According to Anand Grover, founder-president of Lawyers Collective, a faulty procurement policy, withdrawal of global funding from India and other middle income countries and discrimination with the vulnerable population including sex workers and drug addicts were major causes leading to such problems.
  ,
  ,
  The health ministry recently told Lok Sabha that though there were shortages, it had resolved the issue for the time being by procurement and donations from a domestic pharmaceutical company. The ministry has also initiated a computerized supply chain management system for assessment of drug requirement and their stocks.
  ,
  ,
  The latest data from National Aids Control Organisation (NACO) shows there are over 2.09 million HIV patients in India, with the north, south and northeast regions accounting for the majority of patients. The government receives nearly $80 million from the Global Fund, an international aid organisation for HIV prevention and treatment.
  ,
  ,
  The United Nations estimates India currently has the third largest population of people living with HIV in the world. However, NACO data shows a significant decline in prevalence of HIV among adults across the country. At national level, prevalence was estimated at 0.41% in 2001, whereas it dropped to 0.35% in 2006 and 0.27% in 2011, latest data with the department showed.
  ,
  ,
  Poonam Khetrapal Singh, regional director, WHO South-East Asia, said stigma, discrimination and restrictive laws continued to be barriers to accessing prevention, care and treatment services. ""The HIV epidemic in our region is concentrated among populations most vulnerable to HIV: men who have sex with men, transgender people, people who inject drugs, sex workers, people in prisons and other closed settings. Although we have been successful in scaling up the health sector response for the vulnerable populations, more needs to be done. Less than 50% of these people know their HIV status,"" she said.
  ,
  ,
  Though the government is hopeful the HIV and AIDS bill, drafted in 2006, which was tabled in the Rajya Sabha in February and is currently being considered by a parliamentary standing committee, will address most of these issues, Grover said even the draft bill keeps people with HIV and AIDS out of the purview of free medicines.
  ,
  ,
  ""Just by ignoring the issue, the government cannot tackle the real menace of the disease. It needs to guarantee access to medicines for all,"" Grover said.

"Updated: Dec 1, 2014, 00:45 IST",New therapy to cut down HIV drug dose from 3 pills to 1,"

  Lucknow: A new protocol for management of , AIDS will be launched across AAL anti-retro-viral therapy (ART) centers across UP reducing the number of pills from three to one. It also promises relief to patients from severe side effects caused by drugs prescribed under ART.
  
  ,
  HIV-AIDS patients would be put on , (FDT) in which a single pill would be given in place of three drugs that cause side effects and will reduce pressure on kidney and liver.
  ,
  ,
  Speaking with TOI ahead of the world HIV , Awareness Day, Indian Society of Haemetology and Blood Transfusion president A K Tripathi said, ""FDT will soon be introduced across all ART centers across UP. In King George's , it will be launched in mid-December.""
  ,
  ,
  The single pill, often referred to as the wonder drug in AIDS treatment, comprises three medicines given as first line of treatment. Also, salts used in them are better than the previous formula. One of these three (stavudine) was known to cause lipid abnormalities and neuropathy. As a result, fat deposits occur in the patient's body in specific places while it dries up in other (lipodystrophy) leading to severe disfigurement. Blood cholestrol levels also go up posing risk to heart health and causing burning sensation in hands and feet. Stavudine has been replaced with tenofovir.
  ,
  ,
  The other salt called nevirapine had three major side effects, including damage to liver, severe allergic reaction and interference in treatment of tuberculosis. This salt has been replaced with effavirenz. The third medicine called lamivudine has been retained as it is.
  ,
  ,
  A policy decision to this effect was taken in May 2013 and was implemented later. It is now being launched in UP. ""Side effects tend to compel patients to skip medicines, which compromises the adherence rate. Success of the aids control programme cannot be guaranteed unless adherence rate is above 90% which the wonder drug helps achieve,"" explained Dr Tripathi.
  ,
  ,
  Besides introducing this drug, , has introduced changes in the treatment guidelines which promise better success of the programme. One of them, which relates to pregnant women, says they should all be tested for HIV AIDS and if found positive, should be put on ART irrespective or the CD4 count reading.
  ,
  ,
  It may be noted that CD4 count is the parameter for putting a patient on ART. Till 2013 a CD4 count of 250 made an HIV-positive person eligible for ART. After a revised order, a CD4 count of 350 meant clearance for ART. The new guidelines also overlook CD4 count for HIV positive persons diagnosed of TB.

"Updated: Nov 30, 2014, 22:04 IST",Barbers expose customers to HIV infection,"

  AGRA: Even after spending crores in creating , and , awareness, the precautions that must be taken against the deadly infection hinge on a razor's edge. A quick shave could be a close shave. Hundreds of roadside , in the city use just one razor or blade for shaving several customers. This means that with just a nick by an infected razor/blade, a customer can contract fatal infections like AIDS and Hepatitis B and C.
  
  ,
  Shockingly, there is no system or organization in the state or even across the country to check this unsafe practice. There are no checks on the barbers working at various public places, especially at railway stations, bus stands and government hospitals. Hundreds of customers unknowingly expose themselves to danger when they go to such barbers.
  ,
  ,
  Straight razors with open steel ,, also commonly known as cut-throats, were the most
  ,
  ,
  These roadside barbers can be seen at every nook and corner of the town using either straight razors with open steel blades, commonly known as cut-throats or disposable razors. They perform multiple shaves within a few minutes and do not bother to change the blade. What is more shocking is that even the persons who get themselves shaved do not ask for a new blade or a fresh razor.
  ,
  ,
  ""I shave at least 20 people every day. My customers are generally passengers who do not halt in the city but have come for a meeting or an exam. They freshen-up at public toilets at the station, get a shave here and go off to work,"" said Sanju, a barber at Agra Fort Railway Station.
  ,
  ,
  This barber was ferrying his equipment in a box and had placed his makeshift salon on his bicycle. Needless to say, there is no scope, even for sterilizing the equipment or razors.
  ,
  ,
  The barber when asked about his knowledge on HIV and AIDS, he said, ""Ye sab to galat kaam karne se hota hai, dadhi banwane se nahi. Or Itna sochenge to khayenge kya (These things happen because of wrong acts and not because of shaving. If we will think that much, what will we eat).""
  ,
  ,
  He further asserted that he charges only Rs 3 from a shave. If he increases the rates, people will not come to him.
  ,
  ,
  Similarly, a barber working outside SN Medical College was seen using the same old blade to shave patients' relatives. What are the precautions he takes? His refrain is, ""I clean the razor with warm water before using it on other customer. We also sharpen the razor on stones whereby it gets cleaned automatically,"" said Daddu, standing by his small salon on pavement.
  ,
  ,
  He also cited his meager income for not changing blades for each customer.
  ,
  ,
  According to doctors, this unsafe practice by barbers is simply not on the same page as the HIV and AIDS control department. No educational sessions or workshops have ever been conducted for the barbers, who are barely aware of the damger of using the same blade on multiple customers.
  ,
  ,
  ""Prevention is the only viable way to control HIV spread, as there is no cure for the infection presently. The risk of infection spreading is low with razors, maybe two in 1,000 but nevertheless, it is advisable that only one with disposable blades should be used,"" said Dr CP Singh, expert from the medicine department of SN Medical College.
  ,
  ,
  He added that the general perception is that HIV is transmitted through unsafe sex, infected blood transfusions and mother-to-child. These are the second and third highest reasons for HIV infections. But HIV infections can also be passed through sharing of non-sterile sharp instruments such as those used by barbers, incision, tattooing, ear perforation, blood-letting, injections and acupuncture. These too have always been classified as ""other"" reasons for spreading the infection and therefore given less attention in the campaign against the spread of HIV.
  ,
  ,
  ""Though barbers do not carry out procedures that deliberately penetrate the skin but sometimes just a single mick or cut caused by the clipper or razor blade is enough for an infection to occur,"" added Dr Singh.
  ,
  ,
  The doctors when asked how safe is to clean or wash the blade before using, he informed that due to the lipid envelope that protects HIV from dehydration, the virus can survive on the surfaces of barbering instruments for a period long enough for transmission to occur, particularly in commercial barber shops.
  ,
  ,
  Talking to TOI, chief medical officer HS Danu said there are no measures or laws to stop this roadside barbering practice all across UP. This is an ethical responsibility of the district administration and civic body to issue no licenses to these roadside barbers.
  ,
  ,
  ""But these days, they do not even halt at roadside. They ferry their salon on bycycles and its impossible to check such practices,"" added the CMO.

  The team at the , has shown that it was taking longer for HIV infection to cause ,.
  ,
  ,
  The rapid evolution of HIV, which has allowed the virus to develop resistance to patients' natural immunity is at the same time slowing the virus's ability to cause AIDS.
  ,
  ,
  The study also indicates that people infected by HIV are likely to progress to AIDS more slowly — in other words the virus becomes less virulent — because of widespread access to antiretroviral therapy (ART). Both processes make an important contribution to the overall goal of the control and eradication of the HIV epidemic.
  ,
  ,
  Scientists said: ""Twenty years ago the time to AIDS was 10 years, but in the last 10 years in Botswana that might have increased to 12.5 years. One might imagine as time extends this could stretch further and further and in the future people being asymptomatic for decades.""

  Lead scientist Professor Phillip Goulder from the University of Oxford, said: ""This research highlights the fact that HIV adaptation to the most effective immune responses we can make against it comes at a significant cost to its ability to replicate. Anything we can do to increase the pressure on HIV in this way may allow scientists to reduce the destructive power of HIV over time.""
  ,
  ,
  ,
  ,
  ,
  ,
  ,
  The research was carried out in Botswana and South Africa, two countries that have been worst affected by the HIV epidemic. Across those countries, researchers enrolled over 2000 women with chronic HIV infection to take part in the study.
  ,
  ,
  The first part of the study looked at whether the interaction between the body's natural immune response and HIV leads to the virus becoming less virulent.
  ,
  ,
  ,
  ,
  ,
  Central to this investigation are proteins in our blood called the human leukocyte antigens (HLA), which enable the immune system to differentiate between the human body's proteins and the proteins of pathogens. People with a gene that expresses a particular HLA protein called ,, are known to benefit from a protective effect to HIV.
  ,
  ,
  Infected patients with the HLA-B57 gene progress more slowly than usual to AIDS.
  ,
  ,
  ,
  ,
  ,
  ,
  ,
  This study showed that in Botswana, where HIV has evolved to adapt to HLA-B57 more than in South Africa, patients no longer benefit from this gene's protective effect.
  ,
  ,
  However, the team's data show that the cost of this adaptation to HIV is that its ability to replicate is significantly reduced, therefore making the virus less virulent.
  ,
  ,
  The authors show that viral adaptation to protective gene variants, such as HLA-B57, is driving down the virulence of transmitted HIV and is thereby contributing to HIV elimination.
  ,
  ,
  In the second part of the study the authors examined the impact of ART on HIV virulence. They developed a mathematical model, which concluded that selective treatment of people with low CD4 counts will accelerate the evolution of HIV variants with a weaker ability to replicate.

"Dec 9, 2014, 04:00 IST",Sensor measures HIV-cell real time to stop spread of infection,"

  Bengaluru: An HIV-affected person doesn't immediately develop AIDS; in fact it's the final stage. However, as HIV-1 has a unique ability to lie dormant for years, the virus-affected cells will have to be continuously monitored to plan the treatment. So, here comes a non-invasive biosensor that can measure what is going on within HIV-1 infected cells in real time, all thanks to a joint research by teams from IISc here and the International Centre for , Engineering & Biotechnology (ICGEB) and Jamia Millia Islamia in New Delhi. Scientists said that the technology can offer insights that can help in controlling AIDS infection and also provide insight on interactions between HIV-1 and the , causing bacteria, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb),within the cells.
  
  ,
  The team has devised a non-invasive biosensor methodology for precise measurements of glutathione (GHS), an anti-oxidant which works as a protective shield. Glutathione levels are indicators of the level of infection. The team says fluctuation of GSH levels detected by the biosensor also helps understand the expression of antioxidant genes and related , during latent and active stages of infection. ""Earlier methods use whole cell or tissue extracts, which destroy detailed information related to the GSH levels in different areas within an infected cell. We've discovered that a modest increase in oxidative stress is sufficient to reactivate virus from latency. This may allow researchers to adopt a 'shock-and-kill' strategy in which virus could be reactivated by oxidative stress inducing compounds and subsequently killed by current anti-HIV drugs,"" the team's study says. , of IISc says the sensitivity and specificity of this biosensor could be further used in understanding the physiological changes in HIV-1 infected cells and the mechanism of drug action. Importantly, he says, ""We also discovered that Mycobacterium tuberculosis, another major human pathogen, specifically disturbs glutathione balance to increase the replication of HIV. Since TB is the major cause of HIV related deaths, our findings have major mechanistic and therapeutic potential for both TB and AIDS (among the main causes of human death).""

She even evaded questions on the cause of their father's death until the day her 15-year-old daughter found a hospital file and asked her mother about the medicines she was taking., , ""I was surprised that my daughter did not get angry. She has learnt about HIV at school. In fact, she was supportive and said she would take good care of me. She suddenly sounded all grown up when she told me not to reveal about my health status to her sister,"" Ramani said., , Not many parents with HIV reveal their health status to their children. A study by National Institute for Research in Tuberculosis found that only 24% of people with HIV disclosed their status to their children. The study involved interviews with 115 parents with HIV. Those who disclosed it did so only to protect their children from risky behaviour or in the hope that they would be taken care of when they fall ill., , While the rest did not reveal their status to their children because they were afraid of losing respect or being treated with indifference, the study highlighted the need to teach healthcare providers to help patients with full disclosure., , Only 39% were able to disclose their status by themselves; in the rest of the cases, children came to know of their parents' health condition on their own during hospital visits, reading case files or overhearing conversations between the parent and the health provider., , The study said the trend was worrying as improper disclosure without clear explanations could frighten a child, , . Most of the disclosures were by those widowed, separated or divorced where the child would already be going through a trauma of a broken family, , . Disclosure was also more likely where both parents were positive., , Not all children were accepting and understanding of their parents' health status.

Once the disclosure is made, children need to be equipped to deal with the status through periodic interventions and counselling.

  At OFFER these children are being trained at skills like computer operation, bakery and house-keeping etc. OFFER has started approaching corporate houses and other organisations to tie up for the rehabilitation project.

  President of the NGO, Jagjit Singh Mann, while talking to ToI, said: ""When it comes to keeping the identity of the HIV positive patient confidential, there are very minute things on which people need to focus, otherwise it can lead to discrimination against them in society. Keeping in mind the guidelines, some outreach workers or their family members are supposed to be HIV positive patients. If Dr Sooch knew that the identity of the HIV positive outreach worker was being discussed openly, then he should have been taken care to conceal it. However, until now, none of the staff working with the outreach worker knew that she was HIV positive. But after this disclosure, she is under threat of discrimination at her workplace, and also where she lives.""

  These shortages have been continuing for around eight months in states such as Haryana, Uttarakhand and Madhya Pradesh, which have relatively high HIV prevalence.

  MUMBAI: The ,, in an RTI response, has revealed that nearly 1,000 people contracted the human immunodeficiency (,) virus in Maharashtra due to transfusion of infected blood over the past five years. The state has earned the dubious third position after Uttar Pradesh and Gujarat to report this alarming trend, raising a serious question over the quality of blood transfused to unsuspecting patients.
  
  ,
  The shocking disclosure comes at a time when the , have had people believe that transfusion-transmitted infection has almost been eliminated. The RTI response showed that between April and October 2014, around 629 people across the country, including 80 in the state, got HIV through blood transfusion. The cumulative count for the past five years is 8,983 people who got HIV through , in India.
  ,
  ,
  The data collected from , (ICTC) through voluntary disclosure of clients, though, has raised a storm among the HIV-fighting agencies at the state and the Centre. While officials have questioned its veracity, activists insist the numbers expose the glaring lack of accountability when it comes to ensuring quality of blood supplied by blood banks. Interestingly, nodal agencies such as the State Blood Transfusion Council (SBTC) and the Maharashtra State Aids Control Society (MSACS) have put the onus on each other to ensure blood banks play by the rule and detect every HIV case.
  ,
  ,
  Experts say a fundamental problem is the fact that HIV in most blood banks is still tested through enzyme-linked immune-sorbent assay test (ELISA) that has an innate shortcoming. ""If a person has recently contracted HIV, this test may not show. It can detect HIV antibodies that take a minimum of three months to show in the blood. So if a person donates blood, it will end up getting transfused,"" said an ICTC staffer from Parel's KEM Hospital.
  ,
  ,
  ""Due to financial constraints, most blood banks have not graduated to advanced tests such as nuclear acid testing (NAT) that cut down the HIV detection window period from few months to a week,"" said Vinay Shetty of NGO Think Foundation. Currently, only a handful of the city's leading private hospitals offer NAT-tested blood, which again comes at a premium fee of at least Rs 1,200 per unit. ""None of the state-run and BMC blood banks, however, have this facility,"" he said.
  ,
  ,
  ,
  ,
  ,
  ,
  ,
  In fact, there is also a worrying amount of negligence while conducting and then screening blood, said a senior technician from a leading blood bank. ""Any person who tests positive for HIV during a donation camp is seldom informed about his status or referred to an ICTC centre, although both are mandatory. Therefore, that person goes about donating several times till he is detected at some point,"" said the technician, adding that several youngsters, in fact, bank on blood camps to find out about their status. ""Once they do not get follow-up calls, they go about things normally,"" he added.
  ,
  ,
  Officials from the SBTC, though, feel the numbers are not that bad given that there are 11 lakh donations on an average annually. ""How much can we trust voluntary disclosures by people who may be unwilling to disclose how they actually contracted the virus? Also, SBTC's role is to ensure blood is available for everyone. The infection part is dealt with by MSACS,"" said Dr Sanjay Jadhav, director, State Blood Transfusion Council (SBTC).
  ,
  ,
  MSACS, on the other hand, said it is SBTC that monitors all activities of blood banks. ""The information on number of people infected with HIV due to infected blood transfusion is not available with us. There is an option of recording the mode of transmission of HIV for clients being tested at ICTC. However, there are no means to verify this,"" said Khushalsinh Pardeshi, project director, MSACS. The bickering between the agencies also highlights how none of them may be actively monitoring the number of HIV infections happening through the transfusion route.
  ,
  ,
  According to MSACS data, annual new HIV infections in Maharashtra have reduced from 10,431 in 2007 to 5,893 in 2011 while there has been a 49% decline in AIDS related deaths.

"Feb 6, 2015, 04:58 IST",Smartphone dongle detects HIV in 15 mins,"

  WASHINGTON: Researchers have developed a low-cost smartphone dongle that can simultaneously detect HIV and syphilis from a finger prick of blood in just 15 minutes.
  
  ,
  The device, developed by a team of researchers led by ,, associate %professor at Columbia University School of Engineering and Applied Science, can perform a point-of-care test that simultaneously detects three infectious disease markers. %The device replicates, for the first time, all %mechanical, optical and electronic functions of a lab-based blood test, researchers said.
  ,
  ,
  The device performs an , (,) without requiring any stored energy: all necessary power is drawn from the smartphone. It performs a triplexed immunoassay not currently available in a single test format: HIV antibody, treponemal-specific antibody for syphilis, and non-treponemal antibody for active syphilis infection.
  ,
  ,
  The accessory or dongle easily connects to a smartphone or computer and was recently piloted by health care workers in Rwanda who tested whole blood obtained via a finger prick from 96 patients who were enrolling into prevention-of-mother-to-child-transmission cli8nics or voluntary counselling and testing centers. ""Our work shows that a full laboratory-quality immunoassay can be run on a smartphone accessory,"" said Sia.

Sia's %team developed the dongle to be small and light enough to fit into one hand. and to run assays on disposable plastic cassettes with pre-loaded reagents, where disease-specific zones provided an objective read-out, much like an ELISA assay.
  ,
  ,
  Sia estimates the dongle will have a manufacturing cost of USD 34, much lower than the USD 18,450 that typical ELISA equipment runs.
  ,
  ,
  The team made two main innovations to the dongle to achieve low power consumption, a must in places that do not always have electricity.
  ,
  ,
  The researchers eliminated the power-consuming electrical pump by using a ""one-push vacuum,"" where a user mechanically activates a negative-pressure chamber to move a sequence of reagents pre-stored on a cassette.
  ,
  ,
  The process is durable, requires little user training, and needs no maintenance or additional manufacturing.
  ,

  Sia's team removed the need for a battery by using the audio jack for transmitting power and for data transmission. And, because audio jacks are standardised among smartphones, the dongle can be attached to any compatible smart device in a plug-and-play manner.

"Feb 16, 2015, 06:40 IST",New aggressive form of HIV accelerates AIDS,"

  LONDON: A new aggressive form of , can progress to , in just three years - so rapidly that patients may not even realize they were infected, scientists say.
  
  ,
  Engaging in unprotected sex with multiple partners increases the risk of contracting multiple strains of HIV. Once inside a host, these strains can recombine into a new variant of the virus, researchers said.
  ,
  ,
  One such recombinant variant observed in patients in Cuba appears to be much more aggressive than other known forms of HIV, researchers said. Before it can enter human cells, HIV must first anchor itself to them. The virus does this via anchor points, or co-receptors, which are proteins on the cell membrane.
  ,
  ,
  In a normal infection, the virus first uses the anchor point CCR5. In many patients, after a number of healthy years, the virus then switches to the anchor point CXCR4. This co-receptor switch coincides with a faster progression to AIDS.
  ,
  ,
  Researchers at KU Leuven's Laboratory for Clinical and Epidemiological Virology in Belgium have described a recombinant form of HIV observed in patients in Cuba that makes this transition much faster. The virus targets the anchor point CXCR4 early after infection, shortening drastically the healthy phase and triggering rapid progression to AIDS.
  ,
  ,
  The transition from anchor point CCR5 to CXCR4 is normally very difficult. Researchers suspect that the rapid transition observed in this HIV recombinant occurs as a result of combining fragments from different HIV subtypes.

  WASHINGTON: , have developed a , that may lead to a potent and universally effective ,. Researchers found that the new drug candidate blocks every strain of HIV-1, HIV-2 and SIV (simian immunodeficiency virus) that has been isolated from humans or rhesus macaques, including the hardest-to-stop variants. It also protects against much-higher doses of virus than occur in most human transmission and does so for at least eight months after injection.
  
  ,
  ""Our compound is the broadest and most potent entry inhibitor described so far,"" said Michael Farzan, from the Florida campus of The Scripps Research Institute (TSRI). When HIV infects a cell, it targets the CD4 lymphocyte, an integral part of the body's immune system. HIV fuses with the cell and inserts its own genetic material and transforms the host cell into a HIV manufacturing site.
  ,
  ,
  The new study builds on previous discoveries by the Farzan laboratory, which show that a co-receptor called CCR5 contains unusual modifications in its critical HIV-binding region, and that proteins based on this region can be used to prevent infection.
  ,
  ,
  Farzan and his team developed the new drug candidate so that it binds to two sites on the surface of the virus simultaneously, preventing entry of HIV into the host cell.
  ,
  ,
  ""When antibodies try to mimic the receptor, they touch a lot of other parts of the viral envelope that HIV can change with ease,"" said TSRI Research Associate Matthew Gardner, the first author of the study with Lisa M Kattenhorn of Harvard Medical School.
  ,
  ,
  The team also leveraged preexisting technology in designing a delivery vehicle - an engineered adeno-associated virus, a small, relatively innocuous virus that causes no disease. Once injected into muscle tissue, like HIV itself, the vehicle turns those cells into ""factories"" that could produce enough of the new protective protein to last for years, perhaps decades, Farzan said.

  Just like other living organisms, the genetic information contained in M tuberculosis undergoes a complex process known as transcription in which the bacterial enzyme, DNA-dependent RNA polymerase, or RNAP, produces TB RNA. This molecule is involved in processes that produce critical bacterial proteins that the organism needs to survive.

  City doctors will now not only be able to test HIV positive patients for , (TB) within two hours, but will also know whether patients are resistant to the conventional TB drugs (Rifampicin), a condition known as MDR-TB.

  The , (NMC) runs TB centre at , (IGGMC) since 2007. Now, under the Revised National TB Control Programme (RNTCP) it will soon use the latest equipment and testing tool called CBNAAT (cartridge based nucleic acid amplification test). This is meant for HIV positive patients, who are extremely prone to get TB as a secondary infection due to the drastic fall in their immunity.
  ,
  ,
  The centre has already procured the CBNAAT equipment (commonly called as gene Xpert) under the RNTCP. It will be installed in a specially created laboratory for it in the IGGMC premises on March 24. Dr ,, , of NMC's TB centre, said that this test has emerged as a boon to HIV patients, who are usually also suffering from TB.
  ,
  ,
  ""Under the RNTCP programme, and as per WHO guidelines, we have been told to put all co-infected or HIV positive and suspected TB patient to this test. This can diagnose the patient for TB in general as well as the multi-drug resistant (MDR) TB within two hours.

""General TB patients still have to be diagnosed using the culture test, which takes about 3-5 months. But HIV positive patients suspected to be suffering from TB cannot be made to wait so much. Hence, such patients from all over the city, region and neighbouring states who come to government hospitals here can be sent to the NMC centre,"" said Dr Khateeb.

  He said that cases of non-pulmonary (or non-lung) TB patients are on the rise in general but their percentage is higher in HIV positive patients. They are commonly diagnosed with abdominal TB, cervical lymph nodes (on the neck) etc. The HIV positive patients who are suffering from TB generally test negative in conventional smear test. But with CBNAAT, it will now be possible to easily diagnose them for TB or MDR-TB as soon as their ART treatment is started once they are referred to the NMC centre.
  ,
  ,
  In 2014, the centre had registered over 200 TB patients. Of these, 95% were tested for MDR and some 25-30 patients were HIV positive too. Hence, CBNAAT is set to change the diagnosis and naturally the treatment scenario of HIV positive and TB patients for the better.

  CHENNAI: It's been barely a few months since Lakshmi lost her husband to ,. Coming to terms with the fact she and her six-year-old daughter are HIV positive, the 30-year-old daily wage worker is also faced with another challenge. Her daughter is underweight and Lakshmi is unable to provide her with nutritious meals because she has to spend most of her earnings on medicines. ""I can only afford rice, not green leafy vegetables, milk and eggs that the doctor advised for my daughter. Where will I find the money for it,"" she says.
  
  ,
  Lakshmi is not the exception. A study conducted by the , (NIRT) in the city found that more than half the children (59%) living with HIV hail from families that do not have reliable access to sufficient quantity of affordable and nutritious food, leading to malnutrition. This is mainly because HIV hits the productive age groups the most, causing a dip in the family income and reduced food availability for the entire household.

The proportion was high especially when compared to data from the National Family Health Survey which shows the national average for underweight children and those with stunted growth below the age of five varies between 40 and 50% and between 48 and 60% respectively.
  ,
  ,
  ,
  ,
  ,
  The 147 children aged between one and 15 years surveyed for the study conducted at the anti-retroviral treatment (ART) centre of a government tertiary-care hospital were either under the care of a single parent, mostly the mother as the father had died of HIV, or under foster care.

  "", in households is a problem across the country and one might ask why only children with HIV. Infections like HIV are catabolic diseases which results in diminished muscle mass and body fat. So, the daily dietary need of those with HIV is more,"" says C Padmapriyadarsini, scientist, NIRT.
  ,
  ,
  ,
  ,
  ,
  Since malnutrition in early childhood has a spiralling effect leading to decreased cognitive, psychosocial and physical development which would affect the academic performance of the child, NIRT has recommended measures to complement the ART course. While Anti-Retroviral Therapy has been effective in controlling the disease, the study suggests interventions like targeted food assistance to the families.
  ,
  ,
  ,

  Padmapriyadarsini says that a nutritional supplement would also go a long way in increasing adherence to drug management and improving nutritional status. The drugs would then act better on the individual without adverse effects and it would enhance a child's development.

  ,
  ,

  The children involved in the NIRT study have been regularly provided with such nutritional supplements and their parents trained to provide such a diet at home at low cost. The study was done in association with Institute of Child Health and Hospital For Children and Tamil Nadu State AIDS Control Society. NIRT now hopes that it can convince policymakers to adopt a similar strategy on a broader level. According to the National AIDS Control Organisation, there are 6,504 children living with HIV/AIDS in Tamil Nadu. Of these, 2,201 are boys and 1,849 are girls aged below 15, who are on ART as of September 2014.

"Updated: Mar 15, 2015, 14:44 IST",Anti-herpes drug may help treat HIV: Study,"

  WASHINGTON: A common herpes drug can reduce the levels of , infection, a new study has found.
  
  ,
  The finding rebuts earlier scientific assumptions that Valacyclovir (Valtrex) required the presence of the other infection to benefit patients with HIV-1, researchers said.
  ,
  ,
  The result not only means that Valacyclovir can be used effectively with a broader range of HIV-1 patients, but also suggests promising new avenues for the development of HIV-fighting drugs.
  ,
  ,
  ,
  ,
  ,
  This insight is particularly significant given that some forms of HIV-1 have become resistant to existing medications.
  ,
  ,
  ""These results demonstrated that the mechanism by which Valacyclovir acts against HIV is not only through the presence of HSV-2,"" said senior author Benigno Rodriguez, associate professor of medicine and infectious diseases, Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine in US.
  ,
  ,
  Rodriguez said studies by these groups helped illuminate exactly how the medication decreases HIV-1 levels.
  ,
  ,
  ,
  ,
  ,
  ,
  Valacyclovir is activated in virus-infected cells, and then blocks the ability of HIV to reproduce. HIV-1 can lead to the immune deficiency known as AIDS.
  ,
  ,
  Scientists previously thought that Valacyclovir helped reduce HIV levels and worked by decreasing the immune activation caused by HSV-2.
  ,
  ,
  With fewer immune cells to attack, the theory went, HIV-1 could not spread as widely.
  ,
  ,
  After conducting laboratory studies with Acyclovir, an earlier sibling drug of Valacyclovir, Leonid Margolis, of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), saw that the medication clearly blocked HIV-1 reproduction, even when HSV-2 was absent.
  ,
  ,
  Those results helped spur clinical trials of Valacyclovir in people.
  ,
  ,
  ,
  ,
  ,
  ,
  Beginning in June, 2009, patients from , and from IMPACTA, the Civic Association for Health and Education in Lima, Peru, started participating in the trials, which lasted until July, 2012.
  ,
  ,
  Under its protocols, half the patients took Valacyclovir twice daily for 12 weeks, while the other half took a placebo for the same period of time.
  ,
  ,
  After a two-week break from any medications, the two groups switched: those previously on placebo got 12 weeks of the Valacyclovir, and those who already had taken the medication now received placebos.
  ,
  ,
  When study participants took Valacyclovir, their HIV viral loads went down, and when they took the placebo, their HIV viral loads went up. Ultimately, a total of 18 patients participated.
  ,
  ,
  ""Our most recent clinical study demonstrates that acyclovir blocks HIV replication directly. The anti-HIV activity of valacyclovir does not depend on blocking the inflammation caused by herpes simplex virus 2,"" said ,, also a senior author.

Also, high HIV prevalence among youth, pregnant women and adults remain a cause of concern. , In the third part of series on Millennium Development Goals (MDG) achieved by state, TOI analyses how Chhattisgarh and neighbouring MP fare on both parameters at national level. , , , Among major states, maternal mortality rate (MMR) (i.e. maternal deaths per one lakh live births), ranges from 61 in Kerala to 300 in Assam (highest) in 2011-13. MMR in BIMARU states of Bihar/Jharkhand (208), Madhya Pradesh/Chhattisgarh (221), Rajasthan (244), Uttar Pradesh/Uttarakhand (285) and Orissa (222) was reportedly much higher than all India level estimates (167). Four states UP, Bihar, MP/CG and Rajasthan together contributed to 67% of MMR in the country. , Chhattisgarh and MP were also going to miss MDG target for 2015 (150.7) by a huge margin of 40 points. , Maternal mortality rate (MM Rate), number of maternal deaths in age 15 to 49 per lakh of women was also among highest (20.2), only below UP and Rajasthan and almost double that of national average (11.7). , Life time risk or probability that, one women of reproductive age (15 to 49) will die due to child birth within six weeks after delivery was 0.7%, higher than average. , As per the sample registration system estimates of 2011-13, 68% of maternal deaths were women in the age group of 20 to 29 years. , Though Madhya Pradesh along with Andhra Pradesh is expected to achieve universal coverage of births by skilled health personnel up in 2015, the proportion has actually dipped in the state from 2009 where it was 56.4% and would be 50.5% in 2015. , , , There have been around 2,500 deaths because of HIV/AIDS in 2011 (last available date). This was lower than MP's 3,324 while highest was Andhra Pradesh (31,347). , However, prevalence of HIV in youth, young pregnant women and adults was much higher than MP and more than national average in youth category while at par in the rest. Also Chhattisgarh reported double the number of new infections (4,565) than MP (2,387)in 15+ age group which is a cause for concern. This could be attributed due to the fact that condom use rate was lower in Chhattisgarh than MP (2.9 and 4.8 respectively). Both states were also lower on condom use rate among contraceptives use in India (5.2). While female sterilizations remain the preferred choice of contraceptives in both urban and rural pollution, it doesn't protect against HIV incidence. , MP and Chhattisgarh reported more than two lakh malaria cases in 2014 out of the 10.7 lakh total cases in the country with over a lakh cases reported from the latter state. MP reported more deaths in 2013 but fewer deaths than Chhattisgarh in 2014. More than a 1,000 deaths were reported pan India in 2013 and 2014. , 85% cases in 2014 in CG were caused by Plasmodium falciparum parasite, which is critical as it is prone to develop severity and death.

"Rema Nagarajan,Updated: Apr 4, 2015, 04:38 IST","Malnutrition behind 55% of TB cases in India, not HIV","

  NEW DELHI: The search for a tuberculosis vaccine has proved elusive despite decades of research. However, there is one vaccine that has been found to cut , disease incidence in India by half — food.
  
  ,
  Chronic lack of adequate food is the reason for more than half of the TB infections here progressing to become a fullblown disease, says a study.
  ,
  ,
  In an international publication 'Eradicating TB - Challenges, Perspectives, Solutions', of the Observer Research Foundation, experts from across the world and India stressed on the need for India's TB control programme to take into account the role of social conditions such as rising inequity, ,, poverty and over-crowding in the spread of TB.
  ,
  ,
  Even though 40% of the Indian population or 480 million people carry the TB bug within their body, TB cases annually is estimated to be 2.3 million, a fraction of those who carry the infection. ""Over 90% of those carrying the TB bug are able to prevent the infection from becoming TB disease with the help of the body's immune system. Anything that reduces the strength of one's immunity, like lack of good nutritious food, increases the risk of contracting TB,"" explained Dr Anurag Bhargava of the Himalayan Institute of Medicine and an expert on TB treatment.
  ,
  ,
  Instead of Direct Observed Treatment Short course (DOTS), a World Health Organisation (WHO) concept, Dr Bhargava felt that it might be more effective to have a programme more suited to Indian needs called DOST—Directly Observed and Supported Treatment - which would offer TB patients and their families nutritional support and counselling through behavorial change of healthcare providers along with treatment.
  ,
  ,
  He added that several studies have shown that unlike many African countries, where HIV is the biggest risk factor for TB, in India, 55% of TB is attributable to under nutrition.
  ,
  ,
  ,
  ,
  ,
  An annual estimated mortality of 2, 70,000 deaths means that TB claims one life in India every two minutes. According to R S Gupta, former deputy director general of the Central TB Division in India, malnutrition is one of the primary reasons for the high incidence of TB. ""TB patients suffers from loss of appetite, nutrient malabsorption, micronutrient malabsorption and altered metabolism, which leads to wasting. Deficiency in proteins and micronutrients increases the risk of TB. It has been found that malnourished TB patients have delayed recovery and higher mortality rates than well-nourished patients,"" said Gupta.
  ,
  ,
  ""It cannot be stressed enough that without ensuring better nutrition and environmental conditions, mere medication, no matter how good and effectively administered, is unlikely to solve the problem,"" said Harsh Sethi of the Observer Research Foundation. He added that, an underfed citizenry forced to live in unsanitary surroundings is unlikely to respond favourably to medical care.

In 2013, 505 new cases were detected whereas in 2014 the number fell to 449., , Vandana Pathankar, project director, GSACS, said that on April 1 they completed 10 years of introduction of ART therapy in Goa. While initially there was only one ART centre located in Goa Medical College (GMC) and Hospital, Bambolim, which catered to over 1,000 patients, where free anti-retroviral drugs were made available, subsequently link ART plus centers were opened in the South Goa district hospital, Margao, sub-district hospital, Ponda and Cottage hospital, Chicalim., , A large number of HIV infections occurred through the perinatal route, and annual infections through this route were between 4 to 5%. The GSACS has adopted Prevention of Parent-to-child Transmission (PPTCT) strategy which is considered cost-effective method in controlling the virus via this route. This programme basically helps effective reduction of mother-to-child transmission of HIV infection by providing quality antenatal care including preventive services., , Since introduction of this programme, HIV prevalence rate among antenatal mothers who accepted HIV test has decreased from 1.48 %, in 2003 to 0.18 in 2013., , GSACS's annual bulletin has revealed that 89% of the spouses who opted for HIV test were tested positive, and HIV prevalence directly in labour has decreased from 2.46% in 2003 to 0% in 2013., , Also, prominent change noted by GSACS is that the proportion of direct walk-in persons undergoing HIV testing has registered a steep increase — this is also true of female patients., , Currently, GSACS also focuses on improving HIV/AIDs awareness, controlling sexually transmitted diseases (STD), including condom promotion, and ensuring availability of safe blood and blood products., , Another focus area of GSACS is ART. The ART, though it does not cure HIV, it slows down the virus from multiplying so fewer viruses attack the immune system once an HIV positive person starts the treatment, says a doctor at GSACS., , An HIV positive person on ART therapy can to a large extent lead a healthy life but subject to good adherence to the first line of ART. The GSACS now offers at GMC's ART centre the second line of ART also which was not available in Goa earlier. HIV patients with a failure of first line of ART, were referred to J J Hospital, Mumbai., ,  "

  CHENNAI: Adding a , fortified with , to the diet of ,, along with regular treatment, can , and general health, a new study has found.
  
  ,
  The study by National Institute for Research in Tuberculosis had about 282 patients getting macronutrient supplement at Tuberculosis Research Centre clinics in Chennai and Madurai for six months. It showed not just significant improvement in nutritional parameters, but also that the CD4 cell count of these patients remained stable, indicating their immunity was being maintained. The patients who took part in the study were were not on antiretroviral therapy (ART).
  ,
  ,
  CD4 cells are a type of white blood cells that protect the body from infection. Once infected with HIV, the cells are attacked and destroyed by the virus. However, at the time of the study, the guideline recommended initiation of ART before CD4 cell counts decrease below 250 cells while the recent guidelines suggest 350 cells.
  ,
  ,
  Malnutrition in HIV-positive adults is an issue that requires special attention as it leads to faster disease progression, high mortality rate and suboptimal response to anti-retroviral therapy. And if they are the bread winners, it could affect the whole family.
  ,
  ,
  The nutritional parameters that were observed to have significantly increased among the group that received macronutrient supplement are body weight, body mass index, mid-arm circumference, fat-free mass, and body cell mass. The observation was compared with that of a control group of 79 patients who received only standard care. This group did not show any improvement, and their CD4 count dropped.
  ,
  ,
  ,
  ,
  ,
  While the standard care involved treatment to prevent other diseases and treating common infections, by providing multivitamin tablets, nutritional counselling and psychosocial support. The supplement group, meanwhile, also got a mixture of whole wheat and soya bean flour fortified with vitamins and folic acid, providing a high-calorie, high-protein diet.
  ,
  ,
  NIRT director Dr Soumya Swaminathan said that though an increase in nutrition levels were observed, they may not be statistically significant. That was partly due to the study design and other biological and behaviourial factors.
  ,
  ,
  Scientist C Padmapriyadarsini says that the patients in the 'beneficiary' group were also given interesting recipes to try out new ways to cook and eat. ""M Being a catabolic illness, HIV requires high-protein content to build muscle mass,"" she said. The study also recalled a macronutrient supplementation programme in TN for all HIV-positive patients initiating ART at government centres, which showed weight gain in treated patients. The programme was discontinued after the funding was stopped.

  ALLAHABAD: Obnoxious weed parthenium or Congress grass, which causes contact dermatitis in livestock and is reported to be poisonous for sheep and humans, has been transformed into a boon capable of fighting HIV-I by a young scientist of ,, Vyom Parashar.
  
  ,
  Vyom claims to have developed a method to transform the extract of this weed into silver nanoparticle which, apart from having various medical uses, holds the promise to kill different microbe's effectively. The work is being carried forward by the scientists at the Indian Grassland and Fodder Research Institute (,), Jhansi.
  ,
  ,
  Vyom, who is doing research under Prof Avinash C Pandey of Allahabad University, has converted the leaf of Congress grass into silver nanoparticle and this research in bactericidal nanomaterials has opened a new era for pharmaceutical industry. ""Silver nanoparticles are the metal of choice as they hold the promise to kill microbe's effectively as these microbes generally have a harder time developing resistance to silver than they do to antibiotics,"" said Vyom.

  Explaining the finding, Prof Pandey, who is also the Vice-Chancellor of Bundelkhand University, Jhansi, said ""The methodology of converting the leaf of this weed is simple wherein its extract is added to a solution of silver nitrate in laboratory and within minutes the entire solution turns into silver nanoparticles."" Since, the method used for synthesis of these nanoparticles does not use any added chemicals, it is cost-effective and environmental friendly and has turned the tables for this weed, considered as a menace.

  It's Mother's Day today. And what does a poor, sick mother, desperately trying to ensure that her HIV positive orphaned child gets his essential daily dose of life-saving medicines get? Insensitivity, buck-passing and indolence by the government medical fraternity and the , officials!
  
  ,
  On Thursday, incidentally observed as AIDS Orphans Day (part of the annual global Aids awareness week), a desperate 25-year-old widow in , was running from pillar to post in a frantic bid to obtain the next dose of ART for her eight-year-old son. An HIV positive person needs to take the prescribed medicine daily, just like a daily insulin dose for diabetics. If the dose is missed, even for a day, the immune system of the patient starts deteriorating. The people at the ART dispensing centre were helpless, stocks were over (The special ART formulation for children is given in a syrup form). When the woman, in desperation, went to submit a written intimation to the nodal medical officer, pleading that the medicine be made available, she was brushed aside. He refused to accept her application.

  The woman, a widow, who somehow ekes out a living working in a private school, is distraught. For the past five days, she has abandoned her work, running to and fro the dispensing centre. The irony is that the medication can only be obtained from the government centre and no private chemist shop in Chhapra stocks the medicine, which is very expensive.

  ,
  ""I went to get the medicines on the May 4, a day before the last dose ran out (This is the practice. Patients are given medicines for a month only, and they can't ask for any advance stock). There was no medicine available. My child is on ART since 2011. What's worrying me is that in January, when a CD-4 count was done, his platelet count had dropped to 311 from 1100. I'm desperate,"" she said over the phone.

No medical officer, so obviously, no 'accountable' official! Pregnant women have to buy their own 'safe delivery kits' from private stores in Patna because the hospital has no stock. HIV positive pregnant women are denied surgery at Chhapra. The official line is, ""So far, no such case has been brought to our notice."" There is no CD4 testing machine, even though NACO funds were there for one unit in each district, it is said. The woman says, ""My child is the only reason I am living, if he dies, I am nothing, I might as well destroy myself.""

  ""Whenever blood is collected, the banks must conduct a test - called the Elisa test to check for HIV-AIDS virus. But, most banks do not do so,"" said Ghanshyam Ojha, a member of Team India, a leading NGO working in the field.
  ,
  ,
  Ojha explained that the Elisa test results become clear only after 36 hours. But, due to scarcity of blood and high demand, the blood is used even before its test results are obtained.
  ,
  ,
  As per records with the State Aids Control Society (SACS), there are 2 lakh people who have tested positive for HIV in Telangana. Despite this startling figure, lack of enforcement of rules in blood banks is raising alarm among doctors. In fact, the society does not even have a record of those banks which do not comply with safety norms.
  ,
  ,
  ""Every blood bank must be checked to see if they are following the proper protocol. It is during times of crisis, usually dur ing epidemics such as dengue, that blood units are pushed out before they are checked,"" said a senior SACS official, adding that it is a crime to send out blood without testing it.
  ,
  ,
  ""The government has made drug enforcement teams responsible for the checks. But in a city as large as Hyderabad, these teams are grossly understaffed,"" the official added.
  ,
  ,
  Dr Ram Mohan, joint director, blood safety, SACS added: ""Usually, testing kits are provided at nominal rates. But there are many blood banks which do not follow testing protocol. It is the state blood transfusion council's prerogative to ensure that bad blood does not reach the public.""
  ,
  ,
  ,
  ,
  ,
  The government should immediately intervene and ensure that all blood units are properly checked before transfusion. There have been too many cases of contracting HIV through blood transfusion across the country. There should be more staff and the latest equipment available to speed up testing in blood banks.

  ,
  The incident came to light on Tuesday when the girl and her mother walked into the Makkala Sahaya Vani office at the city police headquarters seeking justice.
  ,
  ,
  The mother told counsellors that her daughter had been cheated by the man, a driver. She had learnt later that the man was already married. Realizing that they had a case of child marriage, rape, polygamy and cheating on their hands, the counsellors asked for more details.
  ,
  ,
  On getting information from the mother, the counsellors recalled that they had received a similar complaint from a , woman at Vanita Sahayavani two years ago. They looked into their files and realized that the man had been married thrice before and they'd received a complaint from another woman who said he had married her sister.
  ,
  ,
  The woman, who said her husband was HIV-positive, was pregnant and also infected.
  ,
  ,
  ""The woman had complained that her husband had eloped with her younger sister and made her pregnant. As the young woman was HIV-positive, we advised her to have an abortion. A year later, he got into a relationship with the young woman's cousin and she contracted the infection.

"Updated: Jun 20, 2015, 06:34 IST,(Thinkstock photos/Getty Images)",This vaccine could help block HIV,"

  WASHINGTON: Scientists have designed a new experimental HIV , that may stimulate the immune system to block infection from the deadly virus.
  
  ,
  New research led by scientists at The Scripps Research Institute (TSRI), International AIDS Vaccine Initiative (IAVI) and the Rockefeller University shows in mice that the vaccine candidate can stimulate the immune system activity necessary to stop , infection. The findings could provide key information for the development of an effective AIDS vaccine, researchers said.
  ,
  ,
  The research, published in the journals Cell and Science, represents a leap forward in the effort to develop a vaccine against HIV, which has so far struggled to elicit antibodies (immune system molecules) that can effectively fight off different strains of the virus. ""The results are pretty spectacular,"" said Dennis Burton, chairman of the TSRI department of immunology and microbial science.
  ,
  ,
  While many vaccines for other diseases use a dead or inactive version of the disease-causing microbe itself to trigger antibody production, immunisations with ""native"" HIV proteins are ineffective in triggering an effective immune response, due to HIV's ability to evade detection from the immune system and mutate rapidly into new strains.
  ,
  ,
  This challenge has led researchers to believe that a successful AIDS vaccine will need a series of related, but slightly different proteins (immunogens) to train the body to produce broadly neutralizing antibodies against HIV- a twist on the traditional ""booster"" shot, where a person is exposed to the same immunogen multiple times.
  ,
  ,
  The scientists tested one of these potential proteins, an immunogen called eOD-GT8 60mer, using a technique called B cell sorting. The researchers showed that immunisation with eOD-GT8 60mer produced antibody ""precursors"" — with some of the traits necessary to recognize and block HIV infection. This suggested that eOD-GT8 60mer could be a good candidate to serve as the first in a series of immunisations against HIV, researchers said.

  ""The vaccine appears to work well in our mouse model to 'prime' the antibody response,"" said TSRI professor David Nemazee.

The National AIDS Control Organization (NACO) has sounded an alert on the unexpected spurt in fresh HIV infections in Punjab and Chandigarh. Experts are calling this 'worrisome' because both regions were seen as low prevalence places compared to other parts of the country. , NACO officials believe the jump may be because of an increase in the number of injecting drug users (IDUs), however, there is no data available on such drug users., , These numbers have come to light when the Union home minister Rajnath Singh, on his visit to Anandpur Sahib last week, had asked the youth in Punjab to shun drugs. His statement upset the ruling Akali Dal which has said that Punjab is being defamed for fighting the drug menace., , NACO's observations have been seconded by another report of the parliamentary standing committee on health and family welfare submitted to the Rajya Sabha in April. It names Assam, Delhi, Chandigarh, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Odisha, Punjab and Uttarakhand as states which have shown a rise in adult HIV prevalence. It also points at reduced funding to NACO which may have shrunk its role in these regions., , Dr B B Rewari, national programme officer (antiretroviral therapy), NACO, said, ""The rise is in the last five years. Punjab has more IDUs than the north-eastern states and that is main risk factor for HIV infections."", , In fact, Chandigarh, which is often seen as insulated from Punjab's drug problem because of its Union Territory status, has started showing some of the symptoms.

"Updated: Jun 26, 2015, 01:20 IST,The sacking of peer educators and outreach workers will directly impact the distribution of condoms, lubricant... ","No funds, no condoms, 3L in Maharashtra at HIV risk","

  MUMBAI: A practically broke , State , Control Society (,) has asked NGOs to curtail their , prevention activities in the state and do away with a significant chunk of their workforce. Over 182 projects that cater to nearly three lakh high-risk population in the state will suffer as distribution of condoms and syringes to availability of medicines and testing kits will take a direct hit.
  
  ,
  The circular issued on June 11 has asked NGOs and community-based organizations (CBOs) to curtail the strength of their peer educators by 80% and outreach workers by 25%. A majority of these agencies have not received a dime from the state body since January this year, and therefore have been grappling with massive attrition due to non-payment of salaries.
  ,
  ,
  The sacking of peer educators and outreach workers will directly impact the distribution of condoms, lubricants and syringes in the state's most vulnerable pockets. Peer educators are members or leaders who belong to the high-risk community (female sex workers, transgenders and men having sex with men) and carry out the crucial task of distributing condoms and motivating people to get tested.
  ,
  ,
  The MSACS in its circular blamed the change in funding pattern of the National Aids Control Organisation (NACO) for the delay in receiving funds, which are likely to arrive only by October this year. However, TOI has learned that , had released around Rs 8 crore as a contingency measure, which has been lying with the state treasury for the past two months. Project director Khushalsinh Pardeshi could not be reached for comment.
  ,
  ,
  MSACS that presented an annual budget of Rs 130.12 crore had received only three-fourths of the money. The annual plan for 2015-2016 of nearly Rs 200 crore is yet to be approved by NACO, which has committed only 80% or less.
  ,
  ,
  Maharashtra till date remains one of the six high-risk states in the country with a prevalence rate of 0.40%. According to NACO's annual report, over 40,000 people had tested positive for HIV in 2013-2014 out of the 20 lakh who were tested, indicating that the HIV scare is still very pertinent.
  ,
  ,
  The fund crunch, said to be one of the worst for the state body, has already started affecting people living with HIV. The stock of anti-retroviral medicines that keep nearly 1.80lakh adults and 11,000 children alive is erratic. While NACO provides the ART drugs, MSACS would often financially support NGOS to locally purchase drugs if the drugs did not come on time. ""CBOs like us are struggling for existence. Who do you think will worry about some patients not getting medicines on time or progressing to the second line?"" asked a Pune-based agency that is thinking of giving up three of its projects.
  ,
  ,
  The crisis has also reached the state body's doorstep. Sources told TOI that the last lot of condoms has already been distributed to NGOs, while consumables required to draw blood and carry out HIV tests are long over at MSACS. Worse, the state body has run out of paper to print HIV test reports at several of its Integrated Centres for Counselling and Testing (ICTC).
  ,
  ,
  ""It is appalling how a national programme used the services of female sex workers and transgenders and now wants to get rid of them. Many of them have left prostitution to work fully for the programme. What are we going to tell them?"" questioned Meena Seeshu, who runs three projects at Sangli. As per the state diktat, 40 of her peer educators stand to lose employment. ""We suspect the rate of new infections is already going up,"" said a Pune-based ,'s director. Following the circular, at least two NGOs have communicated to MSACS that they will be withdrawing their projects with female sex workers and migrants.
  ,
  ,
  When TOI contacted NACO, a senior official from the finance department said that it is time the state bore some burden of the HIV programme. ""We have formed a committee that will negotiate with state governments. We will still be paying most of the money,"" the official said. The country's HIV programme has taken a beating since multilateral organizations, including WHO and several UN agencies such as UNICEF and United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), have drastically reduced or diverted funds since 2013.

"Updated: Jul 2, 2015, 10:51 IST,HIV-1 virus infects and destroys key immune cells, known as CD4 T cells, that would ordinarily mount a defense against the virus",Scientists find potential new HIV therapy,"

  NEW YORK: , have discovered a way to block replication of the most common form of , at a key moment when the , is just starting to develop.
  
  ,
  Transmitted through bodily ,, the HIV-1 virus infects and destroys key immune cells, known as CD4 T cells, that would ordinarily mount a defense against the virus and initiate the antiviral activity of other immune cells.
  ,
  ,
  Scientists have long known that a substance produced by CD4 T cells called Interleukin-21 (IL-21) plays an important role in the immune system by activating immune cells that specialise in killing viruses like HIV-1 and driving the production of antibodies that attack them.
  ,
  ,
  However, it was unclear how IL-21 might affect the early stages of HIV-1 infection that allows the virus to grow and spread unabated soon after a person is exposed.
  ,
  ,
  Researchers from Weill Cornell Medical College, the Ragon Institute of Massachusetts General Hospital, Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard University conducted two studies to uncover this effect.
  ,
  ,
  The researchers created a culture from human tissues, primarily spleen and lymph node tissue. After exposing the cells to IL-21, they introduced HIV-1 and found that after 72 hours, cultures with IL-21 contained more than two-thirds less virus than those that didn't receive the treatment.
  ,
  ,
  The second model tested IL-21 in mice transplanted with human stem cells to create a physiological environment as close as possible to that in people.
  ,
  ,
  Over the course of two weeks, the mice began producing IL-21. After 14 days, more than half of the mice with IL-21 did not display a detectable level of HIV-1.
  ,
  ,
  An analysis of the results suggested that IL-21 not only jump starts the immune system but also stops the HIV-1 virus from replicating during a critical, early window of its development, when it is concentrated in one location and has not yet started to spread throughout the body.
  ,
  ,
  ""This study highlights components of the human immune system that are capable of mounting an antiviral response and driving intrinsic resistance to HIV-1,"" said senior author Dr Laurie H Glimcher, of Weill Cornell Medical College.
  ,
  ,
  ""We are hopeful that this knowledge will help bring us one step closer to shielding patients from this deadly and complex virus,"" Glimcher said.
  ,
  ,
  The reduction in viral load is due to the cascade of events initiated by IL-21.
  ,
  ,
  The investigators found that IL-21 instructs CD4 T cells to increase the amount of a small RNA molecule. That molecule, microRNA-29 (miR-29), inhibits the replication of HIV-1, limiting the amount of virus produced from infected cells.
  ,
  ,
  ""Our study has uncovered a potentially potent arsenal that patients have against the virus. We think IL-21 is one of those arsenals and that deploying it early will be very powerful in fighting the infection,"" said lead author Dr Stanley Adoro, a postdoctoral associate in medicine in Glimcher's lab.
  ,
  ,
  The study was published in the journal Nature Communications.

"Jul 6, 2015, 04:06 IST",Share HIV-control cost: NACO; state non-committal," MUMBAI: The cash-strapped HIV programme is unlikely to get any immediate financial aid from the state government bringing a cloud of uncertainty over the existence of several non-governmental agencies. , Three weeks ago, the Maharashtra State Aids Control Society (MSACS) issued a circular asking NGOs to retrench workforce and curtail awareness activities due to paucity of funds. , Public health minister Deepak Sawant said the state is aware of the hardship that the programme is going through but any fund commitment at this point looked difficult. ""We have already sent a file to the Union health ministry urging them to continue funding the programme,"" he said. , Since its inception over two decades ago, MSACS has always received 100% funding from the National Aids Control Organisation (NACO). Trouble started brewing at NACO since 2013, when several international agencies started diverting funds from HIV to other diseases such as tuberculosis, malaria and dengue. The NACO, now completely dependent on the central government funds, has been facing financial constraint itself. The crisis became more pronounced with the Centre slashing health budget by 17% last year. , Sawant explained that NACO may be looking at 75:25 funding model, which currently exists for other national programmes such as the National Rural Health Mission. ""NACO is expecting us to bear 25% of the programme cost. We have told the Centre that the state is already grappling with fund crunch. So, they should grant funds till we can allocate something from the state kitty,"" Sawant added. MSACS has a budget of nearly Rs 150 crore that is used to sustain 142 of the 182 targeted intervention projects in the state. ""The state programme caters to over eight lakh people, including female sex workers,"" said an NGO from Pune that has not received any funds since January. , According to the MSACS circular, NGOs have to do away with 80% of the sanctioned strength of peer educators and 25% of outreach workers. On onwe hand, project director of MSACS Khushalsinh Pardeshi has assured that the core prevention activities will not suffer, but on the other hand, he admitted that NACO is behind its schedule of approving the 2015-16 plan for HIV prevention. ""NACO has asked state governments to contribute at least 50% of the cost,"" he said. , Stuck in this confusion are community-based organizations, such as Malwani-based Sakhi Char Chowghi Trust that works towards prevention of HIV among transgender and fear closure now as they are completely dependent on MSACS's funds. MSACS, meanwhile, is desperately hoping that the state will expedite and release an amount of Rs 11.89 crore sanctioned by NACO, but waiting for cabinet approval. Till then, over 3000 people, many of who are HIV positive, fear loss of livelihood from July. "

"Sushmi Dey,Updated: Jul 10, 2015, 16:02 IST,The idea is to make testing more accessible in order to prevent parent to child transmission of HIV or AIDS virus.",Midwives will do HIV test on expectant mothers,"

  NEW DELHI: Government is now planning to rope in its foot soldiers to prevent the spread of HIV from expecting mothers. Midwives or 'dayis' will be soon allowed to do HIV testing.
  
  ,
  The health ministry is set to issue a notification allowing midwives trained by the government to conduct HIV testing on pregnant women to diagnose the infection at an early stage, a source said.
  ,
  ,
  The idea is to make testing more accessible in order to prevent parent to child transmission of HIV or , virus.
  ,
  ,
  ""Prevention of parent to child transmission of HIV virus is an essential part of AIDS control programme. While such testing is often available and conducted in a good hospital setting, it is not the same in rural areas and distant villages. Most of the time HIV screening does not happen even at public health centres (PHCs),"" says Nochiketa Mohanty, country program manager at Aids Healthcare Foundation India.
  ,
  ,
  According to the source, mid-wives will be trained by state and district AIDS control organizations to conduct rapid tests to check HIV virus. Rapid tests are cold blood tests done through finger pricking. Mid-wives will be allowed to do the tests anytime during the pregnancy prior to delivery.
  ,
  ,
  The health ministry is likely to issue the notification by end of this month allowing midwives to do such tests. ""At a later stage, the government may even consider allowing ayurvedacharyas or AYUSH doctors to carry on these tests,"" the source said.
  ,
  ,
  ,
  ,
  ,
  Experts say early screening or diagnosis in pregnant women is crucial because if one tests positive than through procedures and interventions the spread of the virus to the unborn child can be prevented.
  ,
  ,
  ""There is an urgent need for India to upgrade to community based testing to increase accessibility and out reach,"" Mohanty said.
  ,

  Estimates by National Aids Control Organization (NACO), which works under the ministry of health and family welfare, show over 22 million people were tested during 2013-14, of which 2,40,234 people were found HIV positive. This included over 12,000 pregnant women who were diagnosed with the virus.

  ,
  According to the report titled ""How AIDS changed everything - MDG 6: 15 years, 15 lesson of hope from the AIDS response"", the world has exceeded the targets contained in the Millennium Development Goals (MGD) to halt and reverse the spread of HIV.
  ,
  ,
  New HIV infections have fallen by 35 per cent and AIDS-related deaths by 41 per cent, while the global response to HIV has averted 30 million new infections and nearly 8 million AIDS-related deaths since 2000, when the MDGs were set said the report that was released in Addis Ababa yesterday by the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS).
  ,
  ,
  ""The measure of success for the United Nations is not what we promise, but what we deliver for those who need us most. When it comes to halting and beginning to reverse the AIDS epidemic, the world has delivered,"" UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon said following the report's launch.
  ,
  ,
  Ban said 15 million people on HIV treatment meant that the world was on its way to an AIDS-free generation.
  ,
  ,
  It also means that nearly 75 per cent of all pregnant women living with HIV have access to antiretroviral medicines that improve the quality of their lives and protect their children from HIV, he said.
  ,
  ,
  The report noted that India ""literally"" changed the course of its national HIV epidemic through the use of strategic information that guided its focus to the locations and population approach.
  ,
  ,
  ""This placed communities at the centre of the response through the engagement of non-state actors and centrally managed policy and donor coordination,"" it said.
  ,
  ,
  HIV treatment coverage for people living with HIV and TB has also increased and in terms of numbers of patients, the largest increases in antiretroviral therapy among people living with both HIV and TB have occurred in India, South Africa, Tanzania and Zambia.
  ,
  ,
  India accounts for more than 60 per cent of the Asia Pacific region's people living with HIV-associated TB.
  ,
  ,
  The report noted that currently nearly 85 per cent of the antiretroviral medicines for HIV treatment come from India.
  ,

  It said the Indian government had also succeeded in preserving the legislative and policy spaces that permit Indian companies that make generic medicines to consolidate their exporting capacities to other developing countries.

The hospital and the two doctors have, however, denied any wrongdoing and said they would appeal against the verdict. , The lawyer, Subhash Mohanrao Pachlore, of Harsul in Aurangabad, was admitted to the hospital by his wife and relatives on July 11, 2007. He had a history of headaches, giddiness and loss of consciousness. A physician at the hospital, M A Majid, sent Pachlore's blood sample to a pathology laboratory for the HIV test. , Pachlore told the forum that when he was being discharged from hospital three days later, the physician told his wife in the presence of relatives about the laboratory report indicating the HIV-positive status. He said the hospital discharge card also mentioned the HIV positivity. , Pachlore took the HIV test again at another pathology laboratory on July 14 but the findings were negative. In 2009, he filed a complaint with district forum against the hospital and the medical practitioners at the hospital and the first laboratory. , The forum headed by K N Tungar and comprising of members Sandhya Barlinge and Kiran R Thole observed, ""The respondents were negligent in rendering their service to the complainant. They have acted negligently by disclosing a false positive report to the complainant, his wife and their relatives. They are guilty of causing mental and psychological agony to the wife of the complainant. , The complainant and his wife must have experienced huge affliction during such a long period and lost their peace of mind."" , Physician Majid told TOI that Pachlore had been hospitalised for cortical venous sinus thrombosis.

This is in contrast to previous years when the hospital used to get three to four cases of babies born infected with the deadly disease, yearly. This, doctors say, proves the results of prevention of parent to child transmission are finally showing. , Prevention of parent to child transmission was introduced in Goa after a significant number of new HIV cases were found to be occurring through the perinatal route— transmission of an illness from mother to child. A change was seen after new guidelines were rolled out by the National Aids Control Organization (NACO) in January 2014., , Dr Wanda Viegas, senior medical officer at the antiretroviral therapy (ART) centre at GMC, said that a significant change was seen after they started implementing the new guidelines. Now, a pregnant woman who's HIV positive is immediately put on ART as opposed to the earlier method of starting treatment in the delivery room after pregnancy. Then, the mother was given a single dose of Nevirapine tablet and the baby a single dose of syrup., , ART is a combination of drugs given to HIV-infected persons with CD4 count less than 350. The CD4 count is an indicator of one's immune system, and a falling CD4 count means a person infected with HIV is exposed to opportunistic infections. Normally, ART treatment for HIV patients is started only after his/her clinical investigation is conducted but Viegas said that in the case of pregnant mothers, they do not wait until the investigation is completed., , ""The HIV carrier who's pregnant is immediately put on ART while an investigation is conducted subsequently,"" she added. Since April, three pregnant women have been put on the medication., , Currently, 280 children are registered with the ART centre, of which 184 children are undergoing ART. ""Some of the children going through ART have now attained 18-20 years of age and are doing well,"" she said., , Doctors say that it is sad as some HIV positive children who have lost one or both parents, are entirely dependant on other members of the family who in most cases, do not care enough. A doctor says, ""We have a case of a boy who lost both his parents to AIDS. His visits to the ART center are irregular as his uncle does not give him money to travel."", , Some children, mostly above 10 years of age, come to the centre alone to collect their monthly dose of medicines in the absence of a family member to escort them.

It is expected to reach over 11crore people across rural and urban India., , Naik said that the government has an aggressive intervention programme to combat HIV/AIDS. The unique feature of the anti-HIV programme is that it has always kept the marginalized and high-risk groups as the focus areas. Over 15,000 integrated counselling and testing centres are now functional across the country. Over 410 anti-retroviral treatment (ART) centres provide treatment to about 7.4 lakh HIV patients in India., , Naik said that since Goa is a popular tourist destination, it needs a robust strategy. This is an important occasion to reiterate that our prevention service reaches every person., , Parsekar said that of the 120 crore people in India, 50% are below the age of 25 and that is why, it is imperative to focus on issues affecting the youth and to understand the challenges they face. Though HIV has declined in Goa in recent years, the government wants to take it to zero level and also do away with the stigma attached to it., , Another highlight of the function is the testimonies given by two teenagers from Bengaluru. Babu Seenappa, 14, and Manik Prabhu, 16, both represented India in the international children's games in Netherlands in June this year. Both are HIV positive and reside at Sneha Care Home, Bengaluru.

The 42-year-old has been an , positive since 2004 and initially he was in a bad condition. Doctors too had given up on him. But today, Keshava is leading a dignified life. He could walk over 3km a day without any support.
  
  ,
  ""I did not think I could live. It's only because of self-confidence and moral support that I could survive,"" says Keshava. Initially, he did not take treatment due to financial constraints. He owned a petty shop to sustain his family. In 2011, his health deteriorated and he was bedridden, unable to even move his hands. Doctors sent him back home losing all hope, he added.
  ,
  ,
  His mother Sathyavathi says she owes it all to the Swami Vivekananda Youth Movement (SVYM). ""If my son is alive, it's only because of SVYM and its volunteers' moral support,"" she says.
  ,
  ,
  Despite his failing health, he did small jobs like starting a mobile recharge shop to support his family.
  ,
  ,
  Thanks to the palliative care facility of SVYM, the bedridden patients and their families get support. The facility, apart from taking care of patients, also helps their family members to avail governmental benefits. ""Now, I am receiving widow pension and my son is getting pension from the government. Palliative care volunteers helped me get these benefits,"" said Sathyavathi.
  ,
  ,
  The CD4 count in HIV patients should be above 350 but if the count falls below that, patients may become bedridden and the risks are very high, says district AIDS controller Dr T Raghu Kumar. Keshava had CD4 count below 50 when palliative care volunteers visited him in 2012.
  ,
  ,
  Like him, more than 300 bedridden needy patients have availed palliative care. Today, some of them are leading a dignified life. ""The goal is to improve the quality of life for patients and their families. The need of palliative care is essential in terminal and chronic diseases as they are incurable and result in physical, psychological, socio-economic strain to individuals and their families,"" says palliative care volunteer Dr Deepak Murthy.

  The palliative care facility has served 345 bedridden patients suffering from cancer, paralysis, spinal cord injury, severe neurological disorders, hypertension, gangrene, kidney failure, cerebral palsy and other illnesses since 2011. Initially, 88 patients were inducted into the programme. Palliative care operates with a team approach consisting of doctors, nurses, counsellors, social workers and volunteers visiting each patient's home and providing a holistic care for patients to improve the quality of life by using an array of skills at their doorstep.

"Shiladitya Pandit,Updated: Sep 6, 2015, 02:04 IST,The website's administrators say the website can possibly achieve much more if there is state support. ","HIV-positive, and now happily married","

  
  PUNE: Arranging 500 marriages in seven years may not sound like a great achievement for a matrimonial website. But for PositiveSaathi.com it is no mean feat.
  ,
  ,
  Seven years ago, when city-based , inspector , launched this matrimonial website dedicated to matchmaking of HIV-positive people, he never thought his initiative would get such a huge response.
  ,
  ,
  ""We do not have the resources to follow up on our registered users, but we conservatively estimate that at least 500 marriages have been fixed among our users. The number can even be double of that,"" Valiv said.
  ,
  ,
  Valiv was posted in Latur in 2006 when he heard about an HIV positive man looking for a bride and thought of starting a website that connects HIV positive people. Operating out of a small office in Mangalwar Peth, PositiveSaathi.com has emerged as a relative success story. It registers bride and groom-seekers for free, regularly organises matrimonial meets and has quite a few success stories to its credit. One such matrimonial meet was held in Mumbai on Saturday in association with the ,.
  ,
  ,
  ""We have had to convince potential users that we verify the users' background regularly, and that their identities shall be secured to all possible extents,"" Valiv said.
  ,
  ,
  Among the first marriages the website forged was that of an HIV-positive boy from Hyderabad, who was working in Singapore, with a London-based Indian girl who had divorced her husband after she found she had contracted the infection from him. She also had a daughter. Both had registered themselves on the website and after meeting and talking to each other, they decided to tie the knot.
  ,
  ,
  Administrators of the website say that the matrimonial process is fairly arduous and one that requires them to stay alert. There are many fake profiles and profiles of married people too, which is why they have to frequently revisit their databases and carry out background checks of users.
  ,
  ,
  ,
  ,
  ,
  ""Another problem is the male-to-female registration ratio on our website as well as in our matrimonial meets is heavily skewed. For every 10 male registrations, only about two to three , register. Also, after the potential bride and groom meet through the website or via the meetings, aspects like financial condition, caste, creed, and religion do come up,"" he said.
  ,
  ,
  The success stories more than make up for the hassles. ""In 2012, we had organised a similar matrimonial meet for HIV-positive persons in Pune, and to our surprise, five couples who met that day went to a , and got married,"" one of the website administrators said.
  ,
  ,
  Then there was the case of a 34-year-old HIV-positive woman from Pune who was encouraged by her uncles to get married again after her divorce. She came to know about our website from her doctor. Her profile was soon uploaded on the website where she connected with a man from Mumbai. They got married two years ago.
  ,
  ,
  The website's administrators say the website can possibly achieve much more if there is state support. ""We do not really receive much support from the ,. In fact, we collaborated with the state AIDS control society for the first time during our Mumbai meet. To get people to register on our website, we try to engage various non-governmental organisations, who have been working in the field of HIV-AIDS prevention. Their participation is very crucial for our venture to work,"" said Valiv.

Accusing the staff of discriminating against HIV patients, Advocacy officer of Vihaan Project (National AIDS Control Organisation), Amruta Alpesh Soni, said the only reason why the morgue staff left the body on the stretcher was that they didn't wasn't to physically lift it with their hands, as the deceased had died due to AIDS. , Talking to TOI, Soni said she and her team were in the hospital last night and they would have shifted the body to the freezer if the morgue staff had even given them a hint.

  WASHINGTON: , have discovered a new , against , infection in the form of a , that prevents the deadly virus from replicating.
  
  ,
  ""In earlier studies, we knew that we could interfere with the spread of HIV-1, but we couldn't identify the mechanism that was stopping the process,"" said Yong-Hui Zheng, Michigan State University (MSU) associate professor and co-author of the study.
  ,
  ,
  ""We now know that ERManI is an essential key, and that it has the potential as a antiretroviral treatment,"" said Zheng.
  ,
  ,
  Antiretroviral treatments are not vaccines; they simply keep HIV in check in low levels in the body.
  ,
  ,
  While it could be decades before an ERManI-based treatment can be prescribed for HIV-1 patients, these results provide a strong path for future research involving human cells, and later, clinical tests.
  ,
  ,
  The next steps will be to test if HIV resistance can be promoted by increasing ERManI levels, said Zheng, who worked on the study with scientists from the Harbin Veterinary Research Institute, the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences and the University of Georgia.
  ,
  ,
  Most viruses have viral envelopes, or protective skins, that comprise similar building blocks of the host the pathogens are trying to infect.
  ,
  ,
  On the surface of the envelope, there are viral glycoproteins, known as Env spikes, which act as valets, leading viruses to binding sites that allow infections to spread at the molecular level.
  ,
  ,
  They serve as a key of sorts that gives viruses entry into the host to begin spreading.
  ,
  ,
  Zheng's lab was the first to show that HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein biosynthesis can be specifically inhibited by ERManI, which is a host enzyme to add sugars to proteins.
  ,
  ,
  By identifying ERManI as the target that slows the spread of HIV-1, the team showed a target in which future natural therapies can be developed.
  ,
  ,
  More than 1.2 million people in the US have HIV. In China, doctors diagnosed 104,000 new cases of HIV/AIDS in 2014. The number of infections is rising, though overall the country still has a low rate of infection.
  ,
  ,
  Currently, there is no cure for HIV-1; once patients have it, they have it for life. While there are antiretroviral therapies available, they can only prolong life, albeit dramatically, but they cannot cure the disease.
  ,
  ,
  Current drug treatments have to be taken for a lifetime, which causes side effects and many other issues, Zheng said.

  ,
  ""We see a way to treat this disease by helping the body protect itself,"" he said.

However, it seems quiet evident that you do not do this in a pattern and also you do not have any emotional strings attached to this isolated event and gave in to a weak moment.
  ,
  ,
  Secondly, you cannot erase the past. So, its deemed fit that you accept and face the reality and have an honest sit down conversation with yourself evaluating the bond you have with your husband and how he would react to an honest submission by you explaining the situation to him. This will help you deal with your own guilt and you shall be able to face yourself again. One error on your part in no way defines all of you and having the grace and the courage to accept your mistake shall speak volumes about the strength of your character and help you in rebuilding the trust in your relationship. In case you feel he may not be able to handle this and the revelation may have far reaching lasting scars you may decide to bury the dead.This was a mistake and lets accept it for one. Don't waste time, rush to a Gynecologist who are usually well versed and trained to diagnose and treat , in women. You owe a sincere apology to your husband and you could do this by making appropriate actions and choices in the now and the future is something you must consider and focus on. You must put in your best efforts to nurture the emotional bond with him. What happened in Vegas may well stay in Vegas, provided the learning is done .

  Guwahati: Lying unused and unstocked, the state's condom-vending machines have found no takers. Even as the state records more and more cases of ,, the ambitious condom-vending machine project has well and truly flopped.
  
  ,
  A fact sheet of the , State Aids Control Society (ASACS), highlighting district-wise detection of HIV cases till December 31, 2014, reported 3,820 HIV positive cases from Kamrup (Metro) district alone. This was the highest in Assam.
  ,
  ,
  Owing to its status as the gateway to the northeast, Kamrup (Metro) district, with Guwahati as its centre, urgently requires revival of the condom-vending machines and more condom-distribution outlets, say experts dealing with the prevention of HIV/AIDS.

  ,
  Assam is particularly vulnerable as it is surrounded by high-prevalence states like Manipur, Mizoram and ,.

  ,
  Initiated almost a decade ago to ensure greater HIV/AIDS prevention by ASACS, the machines were installed in various parts of the city with a high presence of sex workers.
  ,

  ""The condom-vending machine project is not part of our programme anymore. We don't know how or why it was excluded. The project was unsuccessful. Instead, now we have people who distribute free condoms at hospitals and centres,"" said Chiranjeev Bhattacharjya, state epidemiologist, ASACS.
  ,
  ,
  The ASACS report said though Manipur, Mizoram and Nagaland have shown a decline in annual new HIV infections, Assam, Tripura, Meghalaya and , are reporting new infections every year.
  ,
  ,
  An expert of AIDS Prevention Society, an NGO, said the project to install condom-vending machines in different parts of the city was a one-time initiative that met a quick death because the machines were not monitored constantly and a scientific study was not undertaken before the project was initiated.
  ,
  ,
  ""Condom-vending machines are usually installed in places like public toilets. Here, there was no monitoring or regular stocking. A detailed study should have been taken to see how many people actually use the machines. As far as I know, no such study was conducted,"" said SI Ahmed, AIDS/HIV expert and chairman of the NGO.

, The app, first of its kind in India, is based on various international models. The app would provide all kinds of information on AIDS, which is not easily available otherwise. For instance, it will provide information of HIV testing centres in the locality, information on availability of free testing kits and medicines etc.
, 
, The app, called HELP (,), will also prompt users to access HIV testing from the nearest centre free of cost.
, 
, The idea is to bridge the awareness and accessibility gap through digital intervention and encourage youth to know their HIV status. The move will also help the government to keep a count on the incidence and prevalence of HIV cases, which is currently a major area of contention.
, 
, The national AIDS control programme is the government's largest health intervention programme. The programme, run under NACO and implemented by states, demonstrated an overall reduction of 57 per cent in the annual new HIV infections among adult population from 2.74 lakh in 2000 to 1.16 lakh in 2011, according to NACO's 2013-14 annual report. However, the facts were questioned by many international agencies, which said a lot of people in India are unaware of their HIV status.

  The development opens up new avenues for understanding why the HIV virus persists in some patients, and remains dormant and undetectable in others.
  ,
  ,
  While existing , (ART) stops the HIV virus from replicating, it does not completely remove the virus. Destroying the hidden reservoirs of the virus remains one of the holy grails of HIV research.
  ,
  ,
  Led by Oxford researcher professor John Frater, the international research team analysed data from a randomised study of patients with primary HIV infection.
  ,
  ,
  They compared the T-cells of 154 patients in Europe, Brazil and Australia who had their ART treatment interrupted after 12 or 48 weeks.
  ,
  ,
  T-cells play a central role in protecting the immune system.
  ,
  ,
  After coming up with a shortlist of 18 immune system ,, researchers discovered that three of them -- PD-1, Tim-3 and Lag-3 -- were statistically significant predictors of when the virus would rebound.
  ,
  ,
  The researchers found that high levels of these biomarkers, attached to 'exhausted' T-cells prior to patients commencing ART, were associated with earlier rebound of the virus following treatment interruption.
  ,
  ,
  ""Focusing on the exhaustion markers was an important step as it has given us vital clues as to why some people are able to better control the virus after therapy has been interrupted,"" said Professor Rodney Phillips from UNSW.
  ,
  ,
  Study co-author Professor Anthony Kelleher from UNSW said understanding the mechanisms that allow HIV to remain in 'remission' is essential if the virus is to be eradicated.

  ""We want to be able to predict how the virus will behave before we take patients off ART to test drug therapies aimed at eradicating HIV,"" he said.

  ,
  
  ,
  Patients with HIV are encouraged to participate in regular check-ups to keep a track of their health. In high resource settings, devices known as flow , complete the tests by analysing the blood. These, however, are bulky machines that run on electricity. With its cost being upwards of USD 50,000, regions with limited resources can hardly afford them.
  ,
  ,
  As a solution to this, Thomas Boland, a Professor of metallurgical, materials and biomedical engineering at University of Texas has created a less expensive, battery-powered health monitoring tool for use in third world countries. The portable device works by helping clinicians count the number of CD4 cells — cells that are attacked by HIV — in the body. After drawing a ,'s blood, clinicians mix in magnetic microscale beads that latch on to CD4 cells in the blood. The mixture is then placed in an inkjet printer that's been modified to print out cells instead of ink. Rather than printing vertically onto a sheet of paper, the cells are shot out horizontally onto a magnetised microscopic slide.
  ,
  ,
  CD4 cells in the blood automatically attach to the slide, while other cells that do not need to be counted dribble down into an excess container. Doctors can then look at the slide through a microscope to count the number of CD4 cells on it. That number is inserted into an equation that calculates the total number of CD4 cells in the individual's body. The procedure takes as little as 20 minutes, resulting in ultra-quick results. The printer will help doctors and patients in low-resource settings who do not have access to flow cytometers. The next step in the process is to license the technology to a company that is willing to help get it in the market.

  MUMBAI: The Indian Patent Office has denied Germany's , a patent on its key HIV drug, Nevirapine, for a version sold as Viramune XR (extended release), yet again thwarting attempts by Big Pharma for ""exclusivity"" extension on their patented drugs to reportedly block entry of affordable generics.
  
  ,
  The application on the Nevirapine extended release formulation was refused since it was found to be ""obvious"" and lacking inventive step, violating Section 3 (d) of the Indian Patent Act — a provision under which Novartis lost the patent on its blockbuster drug Glivec in 2013.
  ,
  ,
  Simply put, Viramune XR was found to be merely a new form of something already known, without demonstration of any enhanced therapeutic efficacy. Section 3(d) — an important safeguard in the patent law specifically relevant for pharma and chemical industries — prohibits grant of patents to new forms of known substances, unless the new form results in enhanced efficacy over the known substance.
  ,
  ,
  The MNC had applied for a patent in India on the extended release of the HIV drug in July 2009, on which domestic company Cipla filed a pre-grant opposition in 2011, and later launched its generic version.
  ,
  ,
  The application was examined by the Indian Patent Office, which raised objections in its examination report in January 2014 over obviousness and Section 3(d). The German company filed a response through its agents Remfry & Sagar. Cipla then filed a pre-grant opposition through S Majumdar & Co.

One would expect illustrations of princes to jump out of the pages of her book. Instead, there are handmade drawings of her grandmother. , Since her mother's death, Jean, who has tested HIV positive, is being looked after by her grandmother. The biggest concern for families like hers is how to break the news to a child about his/her HIV status. This concern prompted Fundacion VIHDA to come up with a programme for diagnostic disclosure of HIV to children and to prepare them for their life ahead. Two years since, 15 children, having an average age of 10 to 12 years, have completed the programme. , Globally, 3.2 million children, under the age of 15, were living with HIV in 2013, according to UNAIDS. They comprised 9.1% of all people living with HIV. 240,000 children worldwide acquired HIV in 2013: one new infection every two minutes. , ""A significant number of kids in Ecuador acquire the HIV virus from their mothers who may not have been able to receive treatment on time to prevent transmission to the child. As kids grow up, they start asking questions. They know how to read signs at hospitals and labels on flasks. It is important for the child to know that he is not sick and that he has rights,"" says clinical psychologist Dr. Claudia Zambrano, one of the founding members of Fundacion VIHDA. , Zambrano and her team have individual sessions, every fortnight, for children living with HIV that approach the clinic. A specific action plan is drawn up based on the personal situation of every child. ""We work with the child's personal history, their specific life circumstances and his/her family, in order to address their needs. The children are taught about wholesome health, just like in school. They are given a general idea about medical conditions, concepts like viral load (amount of HIV in a blood sample), drugs and how they react in the body,"" says Zambrano.Group sessions are held with peers after a couple of months so the child gets a support network. , Nine-year-old Valentina had stumped a bunch of paramedics at her school when she told them that she had HIV. She had learnt of her diagnosis from her aunt and did not confide in her friends. But when the paramedics started quizzing students about their allergies and medical conditions, Valentina thought it was okay to tell. ""Valentina was nervous when the paramedics spoke to her teachers. I went over to her school and met the authorities. We spoke to Valentina and strengthened the feeling that there was nothing wrong with her,"" said Zambrano. After that episode at school, things changed as Valentina's teachers and principal were more open to the topic. Valentina continued two years more in the same school and is now in college. She comes regularly to the Fundacion VIHDA clinic and discusses updates in her life as a teenager, occasionally attending some of the group sessions held for younger kids living with HIV. , The diagnostic disclosure programme has no fixed duration. ""Kids come to us at different stages. Some of them approach us in crisis after getting to know of their diagnosis in difficult situations. In such cases, we have to work on repair and stress on the fact that although the HIV status is an integral aspect of the child's life, it does not define him as a person. We seek family support and also counsel families on tackling the situation,"" says a member of the psychological counselling team at Fundacion VIHDA. Children in crisis are burdened with a lot of questions and anxieties. They know they have greater physical restrictions than other kids their age. Some of them fear they would die like their mother did. Others are worried that they would get sick often and may not have money to pay for medication in future. ""Children are taught to keep information about their health situation private and not disclose it to any of their friends or acquaintances. But there have been situations where classmates or teachers have found out and started discriminating against them. In such cases, parents or grandparents are encouraged to deal with the situation firmly as we have laws against discrimination of people living with HIV. The child may change schools to overcome discrimination. They work very hard to regain self-esteem and overcome that episode,"" says Zambrano. , At Enrique Sotomayor, the largest maternity hospital in Guayaquil where 20% of Ecuador's children are born, a team headed by Dr. Mercedes Ortiz have been fighting to bring down the number of mother-to-child transmissions, despite scarce resources and cultural stigma against HIV. ""The risk of transmission from mother-to-child can occur during pregnancy, breastfeeding or birth. We provide information to all our female patients on why it's important to get tested for HIV and how to prevent transmission of the virus to their babies,"" says Ortiz. , From the moment of diagnosis, antiretroviral (ARV) medication has to be administered to the pregnant woman and it has to continue indefinitely. Prior to the birth of the child, these ARVs reduce the amount of virus in the bloodstream and prevent transmission from mother-to-child. On birth, babies must be given infant antiretrovirals during the first month of their life and they have to remain under medical observation till they are 18. , (This article was supported by the International Reporting Project.

  NEW DELHI:

  ,
  The US Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) has approved Genvoya — a fixed-dose combination tablet containing elvitegravir, cobicistat, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide — as a complete regimen for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in adults and paediatric patients aged 12 and above.
  ,
  ,
  ,
  ,
  ,
  ,
  Though the drug is currently not available in India, experts say approval in the US is a major breakthrough and may trigger trials for the medicine in India, which has the third highest number of HIV-infected people in the world. Currently, India has over 20 lakh people living with HIV, while there are around 1.5 lakh children infected with the virus. Though India demonstrated an overall reduction of 57% in the annual new HIV infections among adults, it still witnesses around 1.2 lakh new infections and 1.5 lakh AIDS-related deaths every year.
  ,
  ,
  ""Today's approval of a fixed dose combination containing a new form of tenofovir provides another effective, once-daily, complete regimen for patients with HIV-1 infection,"" said Edward Cox, director of the Office of Antimicrobial Products at USFDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research.
  ,
  ,
  According to USFDA, Genvoya contains a new form of tenofovir that has not been previously approved. This new form provides lower levels of drug in the bloodstream, but higher levels within the cells, where HIV-1 replicates. ""It was developed to help reduce some drug ,,"" the regulator said.
  ,
  ,
  ,
  ,
  ,
  ,
  According to USFDA, the new drug also appears to be associated with less kidney toxicity and decreases in bone density than previously approved tenofovir-containing regimens based on laboratory measures.
  ,
  ,
  The American regulator has approved the medicine for children weighing at least 35 kilograms (77 pounds) who have never taken HIV therapy and HIV-infected adults whose HIV-1 virus is currently suppressed.
  ,
  ,
  The drug, not recommended for patients with severe renal impairment, will also carry a 'Boxed Warning' alerting patients and healthcare providers that the drug can cause a buildup of lactic acid in the blood and severe liver problems, both of which can be fatal. The 'Boxed Warning' also states that Genvoya is not approved to treat chronic hepatitis B virus infection.
  ,
  ,
  The drug should not be prescribed with other antiretroviral products as it may have drug interactions with a number of other commonly used medications.

"Nov 14, 2015, 04:32 IST",HIV-2 surfaces in Goa; 15 cases detected in 2 yrs,"

  Panaji: Though HIV-1 is as predominant a virus in Goa as elsewhere, HIV-2 cases are slowly coming to the fore. Known as a silent killer, about 15 cases of the HIV-2 strain have been detected in Goa in the last two years. As with HIV-1, the mode of transmissions of HIV-2 is through sex and from mother-to-child during pregnancy. The medication for both the strains differ.
  
  ,
  Confirming the developments of the HIV-2 strain, Goa Medical College (GMC) and Hospital, anti-retroviral therapy centre's (ART) senior medical officer, Dr Vanda Viegas said, ""It is a worrying factor as the detection of HIV-2 is not as easy as HIV-1. The strain can remain undetected in the body for five-six years.""
  ,
  ,
  ""HIV-2 virus will not cause any harm to the person for few years, but after that the decline in the health of the carrier is steady,"" Viegas said. If a person doesn't get treatment on time, she said, early death is imminent.
  ,
  ,
  Asked what could have triggered the HIV-2 cases in the state, Viegas said it cannot be pinpointed without thorough research, and that the new cases have been reported to the higher authorities.
  ,
  ,
  Of the 15 HIV-2 cases detected, Viegas said ten were migrants including a South Indian couple. Quite a few cases of HIV-2 strain have been detected in some states in South India.
  ,
  ,
  She said the South Indian couple was put on a therapy - protease inhibitors, a type of antiviral drug, and though initially showed to be responding, they stopped visiting ART centre on the scheduled dates.
  ,
  ,
  ""We don't know whether they are dead or alive,"" she added. In fact, this is a typical problem faced by the ART centre as some of the patients registered for treatment don't show up after the first few visits.
  ,
  ,
  The problem is more so with migrants who disappear after the first few visits. The officials at the ART centre find it difficult to locate them as they lack proper addresses.

"Nov 22, 2015, 01:38 IST",HIV+ child to return to school,"KOLKATA: A couple of days after The Times of India reported on the plight of an HIV+ seven-year-old child from Bishnupur, who has been denied entry to the private school where he was studying after his mother disclosed his health condition to the headmaster, the South 24-Parganas administration on Saturday persuaded most of the other guardians that there was no danger to their wards if this boy studied with them. , Not all the parents were convinced, but after several rounds of discussions, about 80% agreed, say sources. They indicated this by their silence, though. It was enough for a ""unanimous decision"" for the child will return to school from Monday. , On Thursday, TOI had reported that the child, whose parents are HIV+, was detected as a carrier of the virus in January. Instead of keeping the matter hidden, his mother — who works as a volunteer in HIV awareness — informed principal Sanjib Naskar. She felt that school authorities need to know and take necessary precautions should the boy hurt himself and bleed. Handling HIV+ blood without necessary precautions can result in spreading of the virus. , Things were fine till June when Naskar informed the child's mother that several guardians have submitted a petition, demanding that her son's name be struck off the rolls. The boy's grandmother, who teaches in the same school, was made to undergo a test to prove that she is not an HIV carrier. Naskar, however, told TOI that the child's mother was raising the issue after the school demanded that she pay up pending fees The woman countered that it was Naskar who had waived the fees. , On coming to know of the issue, South 24-Parganas district magistrate P B Saleem promised to ensure that the boy gets to study in that very school. On Saturday, he called a meeting of guardians and teachers. This was attended by Alipore SDO Praloy Majumder, the district chief medical officer-health, MLA Dilip Mondal and several NGO members who work with HIV patients. , After the medical experts and NGOs spoke on HIV+ and how it doesn't spread through normal day-to -day activities, some parents still expressed their reservations. They asked the experts whether they would have said the same had their children studied in that school. Many demanded that the boy be isolated in a classroom. About 80% started out protesting the inclusion. In the end though, two parents spoke of behalf of everyone and said they have no problem if the boy studies in the school provided he has a special maid to look after him. , Naskar then brought up the issue of pending fees, saying the boy had not paid his dues for two years. Local MLA Dilip Mondal and social worker Sailen Ghosh said they would clear the dues and arrange for a special maid, thereby clearing the path for the child's education. "

  Roughly four years ago, I suddenly found myself in the throws of a seismic and debilitating three-day cluster-migraine-like headache. I was emergently hospitalized with what I believed to be a brain tumor or perhaps some unknown pathology. I was partially correct. Following a battery of endless tests, that included a hideous spinal tap, it was sadly and shockingly revealed to me that I was, in fact, positive for HIV.
  ,
  ,
  ,
  . Those impossible words I absorbed and then tried to convince myself, that I was stuck, suspended, or even stranded inside some kind of alternate reality or nightmare, were to the absolute contrary. I was awake. It was true... reality.
  ,
  ,
  Under the brilliant and perfect care of Dr. Robert Huizenga as well as ""the"" leading infectious disease expert in the known universe, I began a rigorous and intensive treatment program. Not missing a beat, a med dose, or one shred of guidance, quickly my viral loads became undetectable. Like every other challenge in my life, again, I was victorious and kicking this disease's ass. I wish my story had ended there. Unfortunately, for my family and myself, it had only just begun. (As quoted by today.com)

  lead to a temporary yet abysmal descent into profound substance abuse and fathomless drinking. It was a suicide run. Problem was, I'd forgotten that I'm too tough for such a cowardly departure. Yet, despite this loathsome and horrific odyssey, I was vigilant with my anti-viral program.
  ,
  ,
  ,
  ,
  ,
  My medical team could only shake their heads as each and every blood test returned levels revealing a state of remission. Even though I might have been trying to kill myself, one thing was radically evident; the disease was not.
  ,
  ,
  In and around this perplexing and difficult time, I dazedly chose (or hired) the companionship of unsavory and insipid types. Regardless of their salt-less reputations, I always lead with condoms and honesty when it came to my condition. Sadly, my truth soon became their treason, as a deluge of blackmail and extortion took center stage in this circus of deceit.
  ,
  ,
  To date, I have paid out countless millions to these desperate charlatans.
  ,
  ,
  Locked in a vacuum of fear, I chose to allow their threats and skulduggery to vastly deplete future assets from my children, while my ""secret"" sat entombed in their hives of folly (or so I thought).
  ,
  ,
  News Flash: This ends today.
  ,
  . The scales of justice will swiftly and righteously re-balance themselves.
  ,
  ,
  In conclusion, I accept this condition not as a curse or scourge, but rather as an opportunity and a challenge. An opportunity to help others. A challenge to better myself.
  ,
  ,
  Every day, of every month, of every year, countless individuals go to work, man their stations, fulfill their professional obligations with a host of disabilities. Diseases, imperfections, hurdles, detours. These maladies range from lupus to cancer, from paralysis to blindness, from diabetes to obesity. ""Treated,"" HIV is no different.

"Updated: Nov 19, 2015, 03:40 IST,Representative image. (Thinkstock photos/Getty Images)",HIV+ boy driven out of school in Kolkata,"

  KOLKATA: A seven-year-old boy has been hounded out of a private school in southern suburb Bishupur by guardians of other students after his mother voluntarily declared that he was HIV+.
  
  ,
  The student—Shaan—has been studying in the Bengali-medium Deepsikha Nursery School that has students up to class III. The child's mother, ironically an NGO worker engaged in , awareness, has resolved that if her son does continue studies, it will be at Deepsikha or not at all. The grandmother, who is a Bengali teacher in the very school, had to undergo HIV test to prove she was not a carrier before being allowed to continue.
  ,
  ,
  Shaan's mother Sujata learned about his condition mid-January when he was tested after she herself had tested positive the previous month. Her husband Sanjit had earlier been detected HIV+ in May 2014. Though devastated by the test result, Sujata who is engaged in awareness on HIV and AIDS for an NGO decided to immediately inform the school headmaster on ethical grounds.
  ,
  ,
  ""Since my son studies with others, it is important that the teachers know about it so that if he is hurt and suffers a cut leading to blood loss, he is handled carefully and does not infect others. Sanjib Naskar, the headmaster, was extremely nice and assured me that he would personally ensure that Shaan did not face any trouble,"" she recounted.
  ,
  ,
  Life carried on as usual till June when Sujata received a bolt from the blue. Naskar called her one day and told her that her son could not study in the school any longer as other guardians were opposed to it.
  ,
  ,
  ""I didn't even know that word had got around and everyone knew Shaan's condition. When I reminded the headmaster about the assurance, he pleaded helplessness as he was under pressure. No amount of reasoning helped,"" she said. Though Sujata did send him to school the following day, he was not allowed entry. Shaan has stayed home since.
  ,
  ,
  Sujata alleged that a school teacher even telephoned her and rebuked her for trying to questioning the headmaster's decision. ""No one has any idea about HIV. When I tried to explain that other kids were not at threat, they refused to listen and remained adamant,"" she said.
  ,
  ,
  The ingorance is such that Shaan's grandmother, a Bengali teacher in the school, was forced to undergo blood tests and allowed to continue only after the results were negative.
  ,
  ,
  When TOI asked the headmaster why he had reneged on his assurance, Naskar did a U-turn and said that he hadn't shut the door on Shaan but had only informed his mother about the objections from other guardians. ""I want him to attend school but the parents are not sending him. But it is true that over 100 guardians signed a petition and submitted to me for Shaan's removal from the school,"" he said.
  ,
  ,
  On an after-thought, Naskar added that the child's fees were also due for several months. Sujata acknowledged that fees had not been paid for several months but claimed it was because the headmaster had waived the fees.
  ,
  ,
  District magistrate PB Saleem said he was aware of the mother's complaint and had asked the block development officer to conduct a thorough enquiry into it to ascertain the facts. ""Whatever be the case, the child's education must not be affected. I will do whatever it takes to get him back to school,"" he said.

"Nov 20, 2015, 19:37 IST",ART Raipur blamed for 12 yr old HIV child’s death,"

  RAIPUR: , Network for People Living with HIV/AIDS (CNP+), a society supporting , patients, has accused the , (ART) Centre, Raipur, of not providing timely help and medication to an infected orphaned 12 year old child, who died on Thursday.
  
  ,
  Talking to TOI, President of CNP+, Rinki Arora said the orphan child, who was living with his relatives in Durg, was on first line treatment but due to failure of medicines, he was referred to Raipur ART centre one year back. Rinki said since Raipur ART has the facility of providing second line drugs in the state, they had been pursuing the matter with them for the child's treatment but the same was being delayed on one pretext or the other.
  ,
  ,
  She said due to lack of treatment, the child's condition had started worsening and they contacted State AIDS Control Society (SACS), Additional Project director, Dr SK Binjhwar, who in turn directed the Raipur ART centre on Wednesday to start the treatment the very next day. Rinki said when they contacted the ART on Thursday morning, they were asked to get the child on Nov 24, despite being told about his critical condition.
  ,
  ,
  She said the child succumbed to his infection on Thursday afternoon. Blaming the ART for the child's death, Rinki said for the past one year the child was denied treatment despite follow ups with the authorities. She said this is not the first such case and claimed that seven other HIV patients have died due to the same reasons.
  ,
  ,
  When TOI contacted Dr Binjhwar, he denied the allegations and said, ""Apparently there was some communication gap"", Insisting that the child was not denied medication or treatment, Binjhwar said the child's relatives were asked to bring him to the ART on Thursday but they never came.
  ,
  ,
  When asked why the child was denied treatment for this long despite being referred to the ART for second line treatment over a year back, Binjhwar said the patient's report of viral load test, which was sent to Kolkata, had not been received so far. He said this report, which measures the number of HIV virus particles in a milliliter of blood, is essential for deciding the correct dosage for the patient.
  ,

  However, Binjhwar admitted that medicines could have been provided to the child, under expert guidance, since he was in a critical condition.

"Updated: Nov 30, 2015, 23:05 IST",Maha’s youngsters worst hit by new HIV infections in 2014-15,"

  Mumbai: Young people in , aged 18-35 accounted for a substantial number of new , infections in 2014-15. Agricultural labourers and housewives were among the majority to be infected, highlighting the need for strengthening the HIV programme, which is going through a severe fund crunch.
  
  ,
  An analysis by the Maharashtra State , Control Society (,) found that young people contributed to 42% fresh infections, while 6% were adolescents. It showed that 28,925 people tested positive for HIV out of the 21.37 lakh tested. Despite a constant decline in new infections across the state, young adults and adolescents, particularly in rural pockets, continue to be the most vulnerable due to lack of adequate knowledge or access to it.
  ,
  ,
  Women accounted for 56% new infections, while it was 43% among men and 1% in the transgender community. But the trend in Mumbai is the opposite, where most infections are still seen in men, and only 36% are detected in women. The study showed how education played a pivotal role in an individual getting the infection. About 29% who contracted the virus were illiterate and 35% had primary education. The graph dropped to 28% among those who completed secondary education and to 8% for those with college degrees and above.
  ,
  ,
  Infectious disease consultant Dr Om Srivastava said people in their early teens and pre-20s are the most vulnerable due to limited access to information or resources. ""There is an element of irresponsibility for those beyond 20-22 as they have access to funds, resources and information,"" he said. Maharashtra Association of Resident Doctors (,) president Dr Sagar Mundada said pre-marital testing should be promoted on a larger scale.
  ,
  ,
  The highest infection (42%) was detected in the 36-50 age group. Incidentally, a year-on-year increase in this age group has been noted in Kolhapur. HIV in the 51-60 age group stood at 8% and among senior citizens 3%. Dr Shobhna Tehra of MSACS said, ""The disease is well under control. Our testing has doubled and infections have halved."" Fresh infections have declined by 45% over the last five years in the city. Among the newly-infected, 78% are aged 15-49, said Dr Shrikala Acharya, additional project director, Mumbai District Aids Control Society (,). Around 93% of the infections were due to unsafe sex.
  ,
  ,
  But an expert said, ""The cloud of uncertainty has to be cleared from the programme that is struggling with demotivated workers and high attrition."" The MSACS has received only Rs 11.89 crore for the year despite having an approved budget of Rs 104.73 crore from the National Aids Control Organisation (,).

"Shivani Azad,Updated: Dec 1, 2015, 15:49 IST",Doon care centre for HIV/AIDS patients shuts," DEHRADUN: For Anjali Antaral (13), an orphan and AIDS patient who is a resident of Tehri, it is worrisome that the lone community care centre for AIDS patients in Dehradun shut down on Monday. This is the centre she has been visiting for tests for three years; she also received her medicines from the hospital here. Now, her future hangs in balance. , ""I don't know how I will manage my treatment now. I had a proper place to stay at and healthy food to eat whenever I went to Dehradun. We want the chief minister to come forward and support the only community centre that was supportive of HIV/AIDS patients,"" Antaral told TOI. , Many other children with little support from society or families found help at this centre. The cash-starved centre has now received no help from the state government either, despite the very commendable service it has rendered. , The community centre was established in 2009 under the aegis of National Aids Control Organisation (NACO), to provide free residential facilities and nutritional food to people living with HIV/AIDS, including women and children. About 2000 patients avail the facility annually. The centre was run by the Agnes Kunj Society (AKS). , In just this financial year, over 370 people have visited the centre; half of these were children. , The state government holds the Centre responsible for the shutting down of this facility, as it drew funds from NACO. Officials at AKS, who manage the facility, said the expenses incurred at the centre are just about Rs18 lakh per year - a sum the state government should not find so hard to shell out. , Neera Kumari (27), an HIV-positive woman, has been travelling for the past five years from Chamoli (275 km from Dehradun) with her husband, who is also HIV-positive. The couple would get their medicines from here before returning home. , ""This was one place where we did not feel discriminated against. We were not alone here - there were about 15 couples we would meet once in a while who availed the services. The health department needs to think about getting another facility opened, if this must shut. Either open up AIDS medicine or test centres in each block or get us a proper community centre like AKS,"" Kumari said. , Kailash Joshi, who works as head of administration at the health directorate, told TOI, ""There is nothing to be done. We are trying to get things working. I cannot say much, I joined this post only recently."" , Officials had met the chief minister in this matter on November 23, but no resolution was found. Meanwhile, patients complain that although the chief minister and the health officials talk of providing free transport and social security numbers, there is little help forthcoming when they actually need help. , Lawrence Singh, project coordinator at Agnes Kunj Society, said, ""We tried to offer the best services possible. Now, even our resources have run out. Our centre was used not only by local people but also residents of neighbouring states like UP and Himachal.

"Updated: Nov 6, 2017, 11:54 IST",Major signs and early symptoms of HIV infection,"

  HIV (human immunodeficiency infection) is an infection that attacks our body's immune system, the body's natural protection framework. Without a solid safe framework, the body experiences difficulty fending off malady.
  
  ,
  HIV stands for human immunodeficiency virus. It is the virus that can lead to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, or AIDS. HIV is a virus spread through certain body fluids that attacks the body's natural immune system. The damage to the immune system makes it harder and harder for the body to fight off infections and some other diseases. Here are a few signs and , of HIV which you should look out for.
  ,
  ,
  ,
  ,
  One symptom that comes in the very beginning is fever known as Acute Retroviral Syndrome (ARS). Fever is ordinarily accompanied with symptoms like tiredness and body torment.
  ,
  ,
  ,
  ,
  At the point when the infection enters the blood, the vulnerable immune system is hit. Likewise, aggravation because of poor immunity causes exhaustion and fatigue.
  ,
  ,
  ,
  ,
  Rash is the most common symptom of HIV. For a person with HIV, the skin can become extremely sensitive to irritants and sunlight. This effect can show up at the beginning or at a later stage. On the off chance that the skin rash isn't effortlessly treated then it could be because of the ,.
  ,
  ,
  ,
  ,
  The people suffering from HIV or those who have just fallen sick with HIV generally lose weight rapidly due to the above symptoms.
  ,
  ,
  ,
  ,
  Dry cough should be immediately treated with common treatments. If it is done so, this persistent coughing can lead to pneumonia, which is a sign of the HIV virus.
  ,
  ,
  ,
  ,
  These squeamish inclinations which are not effectively treated could suggest HIV contamination.
  ,
  ,
  ,
  ,
  Lymph nodes shape some portion of the resistant framework which is our immune system. When the immune system is tainted by HIV virus, the lymph nodes get inflamed giving a sign of HIV disease.
  ,
  ,
  ,
  ,
  HIV infected individuals also experience night sweats. This symptom is very similar to women entering menopause.
  ,
  ,
  There are a few ways which may help you beat the HIV virus. Here we have mentioned those natural ways that you can add into your daily life and habits to stay safe from the HIV virus.
  ,
  ,
  ,
  Fast for at least 1 day a week. Drink only the concoction made of distilled water, lemon juice and honey.
  ,
  ,
  ,
  Eat predigested proteins for maximum digestion. Products like soy milk contain soy protein and yogurt culture, and are great for health as well.
  ,
  ,
  ,
  Eat cultured proteins like yogurt made from soy milk, that is easily absorbed and digested, and contains acidophilus. This friendly flora produces lactic acid which destroys the bad bacteria.
  ,
  ,
  ,
  Take protein digestive enzymes if you eat hard to digest proteins like meat, eggs, fish or fowl.
  ,
  ,
  Eliminate those proteins from the diet that are hard to digest, like casein from dairy products and gluten's from wheat and, coagulated proteins from like in fried meats.

"Updated: Dec 2, 2015, 13:51 IST",HIV infections on decline in Gujarat's AIDS capital,"

  SURAT: The Diamond City that had acquired the dubious distinction of being the AIDS capital of Gujarat has now started showing signs of improvement. Number of new HIV infections have shown a decline of 15-20% in the last five years. The reason, believe experts, is primarily the control mechanism put in place by the local AIDS control authority.
  
  ,
  However, Surat has a long way to go as it still tops the state with the highest number of ,.
  ,
  ,
  In Gujarat, there are 48,917 people suffering from , of which 26,955 are male and 18,687 female. There are 2,975 children below the age of 15 years who are living with HIV/AIDS. In Surat alone, there are 9,998 people who are HIV positive (5,734 male and 3,785 female) with 479 children according to Gujarat State Network of People (GSNP) living with HIV/AIDS and state government.
  ,
  ,
  Dr Mukul Choksi, a psychiatrist who treats number of patients attributes the decline to fear factor and training of sex workers by NGOs and government. ""On one hand, we have fear among people be it educated or uneducated class. This has led to adoption of safe sex practices to larger extent. On the other hand, large number of sex workers have been trained to practice safe sex and it is being practised widely.""
  ,
  ,
  A senior medical officer of Anti-retroviral therapy (ART) centre in Surat said that improved services at ART centres and increased awareness has also led to fall in new infections. ""Once an infected patient is introduced to ART drugs, viral load of HIV goes down in his body and transmission risks decreases. This coupled with number of awareness campaigns and safe sex practices has started giving positive results and we hope it will serve its purpose in another 10 years,"" said Dr Alap Mehta, senior medical officer of Surat ART center.
  ,
  ,
  Daxa Patel, of GSNP said, ""It is good that new infections have come down, but we only hope that social taboos and social indignation that many AIDS/HIV patients face also comes down.""

  Surat has maximum number of HIV positive patients due to its large migratory male labour population.

  The present method to screen HIV has a four-week window period (the time between a person is infected and the , infection starts showing up in the tests).
  ,
  ,
  The decision to introduce NAT came about when health minister Deepak Sawant was reviewing HIV , cases in the state in a meeting with Maharashtra State AIDS Control Society (MSACS).
  ,
  ,
  The minister was informed that of the 11 lakh donor blood samples tested across the state, more than 2,500 were found to be HIV+. This means that these HIV+ had donated blood during the window period (and probably did not know that they were infected). The minister was also told that NAT test ing is very important to reduce the risk of HIV infection though blood transfusion.
  ,
  ,
  To put things in perspective, at least 1,000 people in Maharashtra contracted HIV in the past five years due to blood transfusions.
  ,
  ,
  ""It was in January this year that the NAT proposal was discussed with the health minister and he finally pushed the proposal to the Centre,"" said Khushalsinh Pardeshi, Project Director, MSCAS.
  ,
  ,
  Presently all blood banks follow the National Aids Control Organization (NACO) guidelines and use fourth generation HIV Elisa testing kits to screen blood for HIV.
  ,
  ,
  According to Pardesi, NACO has sanctioned Rs 18 crore for the NAT test. Six districts -Mumbai, Pune, Aurangabad, Nashik, Nagpur and Ahmedanagar -will have NAT centers and around 300 blood banks will be attached to the centers. Blood samples from all over the state will be sent to one of these centers for testing.
  ,
  ,
  Currently, only two private hospitals in the city - Kokilaben Dhirubhai Ambani hospital (Andheri) and PD Hinduja hospital (Mahim) have NAT equipment.
  ,
  ,
  While a single ELISA test cost Rs 200, NAT costs Rs 1,000 per test.
  ,
  ,
  ""The cost of installing NAT equipment is high. Therefore, it took time to install the facility in state. We will also provide training to the lab technician for the NAT testing,"" said Khushalsinh Pardeshi, Project Director, MSCAS.

On the other, there seems to be a reduction in the central government funds to NACO (National AIDS Control Organisation) for AIDS control programmes and IEC activities (information, education and communication) undertaken through the various SACS (State AIDS Control Society)., , According to officials of the AP State AIDS Control Society (APSACS), in 2014-15, 32,190 new HIV cases were identified in the state with Guntur, East Godavari and Krishna being the most vulnerable districts mainly due to presence of high number of migrants and truckers. Between April to September 2015, 4,00,090 got tested, out of which 12,742 were confirmed as HIV positive in AP. Currently, 1,28,760 people are living with HIV and are under medication in AP, among which 11,566 are from Vizag district. ""In accordance with the theme of 'Getting to Zero- Zero New HIV Infections, Zero Stigma and Discrimination, Zero AIDS Related Deaths', the overall incidence of HIV/AIDS is coming down in the state but we still don't have a comparative statistics yet as the entire data of the combined state is with Telangana and we are trying to get the AP data post bifurcation. Even then, if we compare the overall prevalence among the high risk groups at present with those three-four years ago, we find that in almost all cases, the prevalence rate has come down,"" stated additional project director (APD) of APSACS Rajendra Prasad., , ""In ante-natal women, the prevalence rate is 0.1% now as compared to more than 1.5% three-four years earlier. Similarly, in female sex workers, it has come down from 8% to 4% and in MSMs (men who have sex with men) it's 8% as compared to 10% three years ago. Only in case of Injectable Drug Users (IDUs), the cases have gone up from 8% to 10%. We are trying to implement employer-need models in industries to generate awareness among workers too. We also feel the need for generation of continuous awareness and more IEC activities, which has slowed down,"" Prasad said., , Speaking on IEC and other issues, an official from Naco working with State Aids Control Society, requesting anonymity, said, ""There's some problem regarding availability of funds to fight AIDS. The combined state of AP-Telangana got Rs 115 crore in 2014. But this year, only Rs 94 crore has been given by the Centre. In fact, the central government has asked the respective state governments to contribute 20 per cent of the funds. Given the fund crunch in the two states, such a move may hamper AIDS control programmes. Even IEC activities need to be continued without gaps because today's children would be tomorrow's youth and therefore a sustainable approach is needed to curtail incidence of HIV.

However, it was later revealed that the thalassaemic children were HIV positive and several of them had passed away since 2011.Parents of 34 such thalassaemic kids fought a long legal battle and finally sought further probe after CBI filed a closure report claiming that there could be various reasons behind the thalassaemic kids contracting HIV . , The court agreed with arguments put forth by their counsel Paresh Waghela in case of three girls, who got treatment only at Junagadh civil hospital and obtained blood from Sarvodaya Blood Bank. The question raised was how these three contracted HIV . CBI found one blood donor with HIV positive, whose blood led to one child being infected with HIV after a few months. When the picture was so clear, why CBI did not fix liability on any authority at the hospital or blood bank and nobody was held responsible, the Waghela had argued. CBI also did not inquire beyond 529 persons out of the total 1,229 identified donors. "

  UDAISARAI (FATEHPUR): This Diwali wasn't the same for Anita, a mother of two in this village. When her husband - who works in Mumbai to provide for his family - came back home this Diwali, she insisted on an HIV test before he entered home. But, her husband wouldn't agree. So, Anita decided he would not let him share her bed till he was in Udaisarai.
  
  ,
  Vidya, another resident of this village and a mother of two, too would not allow her husband Ram Kishore enter home till a blood test showed he was HIV negative.
  ,
  ,
  Not that Anita and Vidya were not happy that their husbands were home for Diwali. But, they were scared that they could get with them more them the money and Diwali gifts for all. They were afraid the men may get them disease and death - carrying back home with them the deadly HIV.
  ,
  ,
  The , in this village, where most make members work in Mumbai for a living, have united and are fighting this virus in a unique way: They are making the menfolk - through persuasion and even force - under a test to check for HIV as soon as they reach the village from Mumbai.
  ,
  ,
  Their fears aren't misplaced. For, Udaisarai was like any other village in Uttar Pradesh - surviving on income from agriculture and money orders from men working in Mumbai and other cities in western India - till a screening camp 10 years ago made their world turn topsy turvy.

  Results of blood tests in the camp revealed most of the males were carrying the deadly virus.

  With death staring them in the face, women have taken strong steps. And, if the wives are ensuring HIV tests for husbands and safe sex, they are being supported by their mothers-in-law and sisters-in-law.
  ,

  ""We are helping them save themselves from the scourge of infection and stigma. This Diwali, the women told the men to get themselves tested for HIV when the returned home,"" said Gyan Swaroopa, an anganwadi worker who has played a key role in spreading awareness in the village.

  It was Vidya who took the lead and made her husband undergo a blood test at the Integrated Counselling and Testing Centre at the Fatehpur district hospital.

  ""I have seen members of families which got infected die one by one. Even medicines do not work. The trauma is unbearable. So, I asked my husband to get himself checked,"" said Vidya.

  But not all spouses are cooperative. Anita had to struggle to make her husband take the test. ""I did not let him into my room for two days as he refused to take the test. I even did not let him share my bed for , of the days,"" she said.

  ,
  ""It was my mother-in-law who made him agree, reminding him of the deaths village have died. Village elders too convinced him and he donated his sample before leaving for Mumbai. The report is awaited,"" she added.

  When Sangeeta's husband came home for Diwali, it was her sister-in-law, who herself had lost her husband, who convinced him for the test. Sangeeta's family heaved a sigh of relief when he turned out to be HIV negative. Sangeeta had stopped communicating with her husband till he agreed.
  ,
  ,
  But, when ,, who was married just about six months ago, could not convince her husband for the test, she ensured that he used condoms.

  Elders who work in Mumbai also keep an eye on the younger men. ""Instead of staying on the streets, we get together and pool in money to rent common rooms. This has minimized men visiting commercial sex workers,"" said ,, who has been working in Mumbai since 1999.

"Sumitra Debroy and Malathy Iyer,Nov 30, 2015, 05:39 IST",`Drugs for all HIV patients not feasible',"

  The , (,) has made it clear that India is not ready to adhere to WHO's recent recommendation of providing antiretroviral therapy (ART) for all HIV patients regardless of their disease stage.
  
  ,
  Till now, in India, only those with a CD4 cell count of less than 350 are started under the ART programme. The NACO, for the first time in over a decade, has decided that the lifesaving antiretroviral drugs will now be offered to even those with a slightly higher CD4 count of 500. CD4 cell count is a crucial marker of how aggressively the virus is destroying the body's immune system. ""We have to look into the evidence of starting ART for all. More than evidence, it is operational feasibility, finances, human resource and how the ART centres will cope with the increased load of more patients,"" said Dr BB Rewari, national programme officer (ART), NACO. On WHO's recommendations, he said the guidelines are never meant to be adopted immediately . ""It is expected to take a year or two,"" he said.
  ,
  ,
  With the tweaking of CD4 requirement, over 2-3lakh HIV patients, who earlier did not qu alify for the free ART therapy are likely to be brought under its ambit. Currently , only 8 lakh people in the country are on the ART programme, even though the total number of people li ving with HIV in India is esti mated to be 21lakh.
  ,
  ,
  Physicians firmly believe that the way forward is early initiation of ART in all adults, , adolescents and children with HIV . Dr George Oomen, infec tious diseases specialist, said there is ample evidence to show that people who have started ART at their highest CD4 count, be it 750 or 1,000, do best.
  ,
  ,
  Head of medicine at Parel's KEM Hospital Dr AR Pazare reiterated, ""That is the way world is treating HIV . Why wait for the person to become too sick or for his CD4 count to fall so much?"" He said early ART can not only stop progression of disease but also cut down on transmission.
  ,
  ,
  Parallel to the CD4 debate is that of providing oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to prevent acquisition of HIV. Ashok Row Kavi of Humsafar trust, that works with men having sex with men, said PrEP has been in use in India for the last few years, but its inclusion in national programme may not be a reality soon. ""There is an ideological debate on whether to provide ART to gay men as a preventive drug or first reach out to all women and kids,"" he added. Rewari said PrEp is being tried as a pilot study among female sex workers in Chennai, Mysore and Kolkata.

  Consider Mumbai for instance. HIV among the city's general population fell from 3.6% in 2013-14 to 3% in 2014-15.But the Mumbai District AIDS Control Society (MDACS) that manages health programmes for HIV+ AIDS people has been managing with a third of its annual budget of Rs 25 crore. ""Medicines have had a marvellous effect on the HIVAIDS epidemic so far. Every patient who has managed to get these medicines has not done poorly But we could head for big trouble if patients don't adhere to drugs or fail to get it in time,"" said infectious diseases specialist Dr George Oomen. The country has faced a stockout of HIV drugs in the past few years.
  ,
  ,
  Indeed, while year-on-year, incidence of new infection among the general population and pregnant women has shown a significant decline, that among risk groups continues to be a cause for concern. As per the HIV sentinel surveillance data of 2010-11, HIV among female sex workers in the city was around 6%, way higher than the national prevalence of 2.7%.

  However, the main sentiment on the eve of World AIDS Day is of positivity. ""What is the difference between HIV in 1985 and 2015? HIV+ people don't really frighten others anymore,"" said Ashok Row Kavi of Humsafar Trust, one of the first organisations started in the country to advocate for rights of men who have sex with men (MSM). ""People are living a prolonged life with antiretroviral therapy (ART),"" he said. Our biggest achievement is that we have killed the fear."" Dr Shrikala Acharya, additional project director, MDACS, said, ""We have come from a stage when HIV prevalence in Kamathipura was 54.3% in 2003. Today, the awareness is massive and everyone knows about ways of prevention.""

  ,
  Mumbai currently has over 30,000 people living with the disease. A senior NGO member , who worked with FSWs in Kamathipura, said the disease is no longer a death sentence. ""We probably don't even know how many women must have died of AIDS. It is a rare thing today."" But a doctor said the Indian program faces problems that government officials aren't ready to accept. so far.

This means, the total number of essential medicines, prices of which are capped by the central government, would increase from 348 to 384, including diagnostic agents and contraceptives. The move following recommendations from a core committee formed by the health ministry is expected to make many important drugs affordable or at least reduce their prices significantly to bring relief to patients.

  Calling it the ""best fit list"", the core committee under the chairmanship of former Indian Council of Medical Research chief VM Katoch said emphasis was laid on the disease-burden and treatment guidelines as basis for selecting, and therefore, medicines which are ""aligned with the current treatment guide lines"" and those used for treatment of diseases that are ""public health problems"" have been added to the new list. The new list of essential medicines, which comes into effect immediately, will be revised every three years as per the committee's recommendations.

  The committee also suggested that given the diversity in climate, food habits and culture in India, the government should also consider inclusion of medicines for priority healthcare conditions for different regions. For instance, kala azar is more prevalent in Bihar whereas Japanese encephalitis is more prevalent in Assam. However, the recommendations did not delve into details of how this has to be done.

  ,
  India too has many issues with medication and finances for HIV control programmes; many patient groups throughout 2015 complained out drug stockouts that resulted in the most vulnerable patients not getting their medicines continuously as prescribed.
  ,
  ,
  In a research paper that appeared in the , on Sunday, the researchers calculated that the price tag for providing long-term HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment in 2015-2050 in the nine sub-Saharan countries most affected by the epidemic ranges from $98 billion at current coverage levels to $261 billion if coverage is scaled up.
  ,
  ,
  ""The HIV epidemic is far from over,"" said first author Rifat Atun, professor of global health systems, in a press release sent by the school of public health. ""The magnitude of funding needed to sustain the HIV fight is very large and the consequences of complacency even larger.""
  ,
  ,
  Atun and colleagues looked at the nine countries that account for 70% of the HIV burden in Africa—Ethiopia, Kenya, Malawi, Nigeria, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. ""They modeled these countries' HIV/AIDS funding needs through 2050, based on four different scenarios of coverage levels, using data from Spectrum, a publicly available tool used by UNAIDS,"" said the release.

  The researchers say that 'front-loading' investments now will be necessary to ensure that higher levels of coverage are achieved. This would ultimately reduce HIV transmission and future funding obligations.

  The new plan includes introduction of third-line treatment for over 1 lakh patients, increasing the benchmark for those eligible for free anti-retroviral therapy (ART) and ensuring more supplies of contraceptives.
  
  ,
  This assumes significance as the AIDS control programme, which is on the verge of maturing from receiving international ,, suffered a huge cut in budgetary allocation last year. This led to shortage of condoms, medicines and testing kits across the country. In fact some states also sacked healthcare workers involved with the programme blaming it on financial crunch.
  ,
  ,
  However, this year's budget has proposed an allocation of Rs 1,615 crore for the programme, as compared to Rs 1,300 crore under the revised estimates of 2015-16.

  ""We are taking a holistic approach. Therefore, we have now covered over 1 lakh patients for third-line treatment. We have also raised the bar for CD4 count for those who will be eligible for free treatment,"" health minister , said.
  ,
  ,
  Currently, anyone who has a CD4 cell count of 350, and consequently, a very high viral load, is eligible for free ARTs. Under the new plan, which will be implemented from April, patients below 500 CD4 count will get free ARTs. This is in line with the guidelines from World Health Organisation (WHO), which recommends free ARTs for all HIV patients.
  ,

  According to a senior official, the increase in coverage of patients for free ARTs alone would entail an investment of around Rs 75-80 crore. Besides, the plan to introduce third-line treatment is estimated to be worth Rs 11crore.

  Besides, the government has also cleared a tender to procure 325 million pieces of condoms from the open market, a process which was pending for almost four years.

  J J Hospital's gynaecology department has scored a perfect 100 in one of its most trying tasks: delivering 100 HIV-free babies of HIV-positive mothers since March 2014.
  
  ,
  The hospital, considered a referral centre for HIV-positive pregnant women who are turned away from other hospitals, has performed deliveries of 1,200 HIV-positive women since 2000.
  ,
  ,
  ""We have been working on reducing mother-to-child transmission of HIV since 2000. But we have been pleasantly surprised to note that 100 children born since the start of the three-drug regimen (Tenofovir, Lamivudine and Efavirenz) are HIV-free,"" said Dr Rekha Daver, who heads JJ Hospital's gynaecology department and is on the National AIDS Control Organisation task force.
  ,
  ,
  Without drug intervention, such children have 45% risk of HIV infection during pregnancy, , and breastfeeding. The last 100 deliveries of HIV-positive mothers at the state-run J J Hospital in Mumbai have been more special for two reasons. Firstly, these HIV-positive pregnant women got special treatment due to the Union ministry of health's decision to start them on an anti-HIV regimen for life as soon they discovered their pregnancy. Secondly, the children don't carry the dreaded virus.
  ,
  ,
  Between 2001 and 2002, India started giving a single dose (of Nevirapine tablet) to pregnant women and the newborn. ""This helped cut down the transmission risk to a great extent, but the mothers risked developing drug resistance later on,"" said Dr Daver. Moreover, 7% of the children born to HIV-positive mothers in J J Hospital contracted the virus under the Nevirapine regimen; the national average was higher at 11%.
  ,
  ,
  In 2014, India accepted the World Health Organisation's Option B+ that entails pregnant women taking the three drug dose daily to reduce the viral load in their bodies. ""To ensure women take the drugs daily, the government has worked out a single tablet of these three drugs to be taken before sleeping every night,"" said Dr Daver.
  ,

  But the last 100 have been extra special for two reasons. Firstly, these HIV-positive pregnant women got special treatment due to the Union ministry of health's decision to start them on an anti-HIV regimen for life as soon they discovered their pregnancy. Secondly, the children don't carry the dreaded virus. Without any drug intervention, children born to HIV-positive mothers have a 45% risk of HIV infection during pregnancy, delivery and breastfeeding. Between 2001 and 2002, India started giving a single dose (of Nevirapine tablet) to pregnant women and the newborn. ""This helped cut down the transmission risk to a great extent, but the mothers risked developing drug resistance later on,"" said Dr Daver. Moreover, 7% of the children born to HIV-positive mothers in J J Hospital contracted the virus under the Nevirapine regimen; the national average was higher at 11%.

  In 2014, India accepted the World Health Organisation's Option B+ that entails pregnant women taking the three-drug dose daily to reduce the viral load in their bodies.

  NEW DELHI: India has 21.17 lakh people living with HIV, the third largest in the world after South Africa (68 lakh) and Nigeria (34 lakh), health minister J P Nadda informed Lok Sabha on Friday. Though the incidence of new cases has declined significantly, the government is currently faced with a challenge of sustaining the rate of reduction.
  
  ,
  To facilitate this, the government has decided to revamp its National AIDS Control Programme and extend free anti-retroviral therapy (ART) to those with a CD4 cell count of less than 500, earlier this was at 300. CD4 is a type of white blood cell that fights infection.

  ""The total number of patients with CD4 count of less than 350 is estimated to be at 13,45,678. Out of this, the number of people on ART is 9.25 lakh making a coverage rate of 69%,"" Nadda said. ART is a therapy that improves the life quality of HIV patients with treatment that maximally suppresses the HIV virus.
  ,
  ,
  At present, Nadda said there are 524 ART centres and 1,094 link centres in the country providing free anti-retroviral therapy, treatment for opportunistic infections and counselling services to 9.25 lakh people living with HIV. Based on HIV prevalence in different parts of the country, he said ART centres are scaled up every year.

Although HIV epidemic in the country is slowing down with a 19% decline in new HIV infections (130,000 in 2013) and a 38% decline in AIDS-related deaths between 2005 and 2013, the proportion of people who do not have access to antiretroviral therapy treatment is still very high at around 64%. ,Agreeing to hear a PIL for setting up hospitals exclusively for treatment of HIV-infected patients in every district, a bench of Justices J S Khehar and C Nagappan issued notice to Centre seeking its response. ,The court passed the order on a petition filed by senior advocate Paramananda Katara who contended that every HIV- infected patient must be provided antiretroviral therapy at affordable price immediately after the diagnosis to stop the deadly virus from multiplying. At the end of 2013, only 7 lakh people were on antiretroviral therapy, the second largest number of people on such treatment in any country.,""Helpless patients suffering with HIV/AIDS are dying all over the country as there are no exclusive hospitals to deal with this disease. There are no HIV-testing centres in rural areas and it leads to spread of the virus. It is a fundamental duty of the Centre and state governments to provide immediate medical treatment to HIV/AIDS patients,"" he told the bench. ,Contending that prisoners and sex workers are more prone to being affected by the virus, the petitioner contended that testing centres must be set up in jail premises and red light areas.,HIV prevalence in the country is estimated at 0.3%.

While earlier the rate of infection was predominantly high among men who have sex with men (MSM), the focus now is on women. And this is hardly surprising with sexual route being the main route of transmission in the state, she says.,Viegas, who is exposed to a varied number of HIV/AIDS cases, said of late, she has observed HIV infection among some widows as well. Most of these women got the infection from their husbands. ,Inquiries revealed that husbands of these women died around seven-ten years ago of tuberculosis, which is an opportunistic infection that persons having HIV/AIDS virus get. ,""These women never got tested for HIV infection after the death of their husband,"" says Viegas. They are now coming for testing, when the virus has become dominant in their body.,The GSACS data reveal that in 2013, proportion of females among the sero-positive cases was 42.1% whereas in 2015, proportion of females among the sero-positive cases was 45.5 %.,HIV is prevalent in all parts of the state, and the majority of the cases are reported from the four coastal talukas, Mormugao, and Salcete in South Goa, and Bardez and Tiswadi in North Goa."

He was kept there for more than five months. During that time, he underwent multiple blood transfusions as the injuries were quite serious and could have claimed his life.,The GMCH immediately ordered an inquiry after the matter came to light on Monday. ,""Both me and my husband are HIV negative.

"May 16, 2016, 06:46 IST",Budget cut for NACO hits HIV/AIDS control programme,"Visakhapatnam: HIV/AIDS counsellors have not undergone training in the last two years. Reason? There is severe fund crunch with the government curtailing the budget. The only centre in AP for training counsellors is at the psychology department of AU.,AP State Aids Control Society (APSACS) sources said due to 20% cut in the annual budget for the National Aids Control Organisation (NACO), officials could not take up the mandatory training sessions for the district level counsellors. For the years 2014 to 2016, the budget has been cut from Rs 1,700 crore to Rs 1,300 crore. This has affected the HIV/AIDS control programme. A portion of the fund is diverted to Swachh Bharat and skill development programmes.,Earlier, the training centre for counsellors used to get funds from abroad routed through the Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS) under the global fund to fight AIDS, TB and malaria project. But after the stipulated eight-year period of funding was over, there was no money to continue the project. Project director and head of the of AU psychology department Prof MVR Raju said, ""We used to train counsellors every three months, with around 30 counsellors in each batch. Each ART or HIV treatment centre in the state is supposed to have counsellors for patients and there are more than 700 such counsellors in the state. But since the last two years, we didn't receive any funding from APSACS. The HIV/AIDS control programme is not being given much importance in the last two years. Not only for this project, but for other educational projects too, we find the funds not forthcoming and on enquiry find that part of UGC funds gets diverted for skill development and Swachh Bharat."",Even the State AIDS Control Society officials admitted to the shortage of funds for the last two years and reduction in NACO budget. A SACS official said, ""The new government doesn't encourage international donors like UNICEF and global funds and NACO had to undergo a budget cut in 2014-16 period of Rs 400 crore. The various SACS used to get funds directly from NACO but even that was discontinued and SACS had to get them through government treasury. Every time, there would be a delay of 4-5 months."",""However, the treasury system was removed this year and again we are directly getting funds from NACO and after all the states had complained about the budget cut, the allocation for NACO has been raised to its earlier Rs 1,700 crore from this fiscal. But due to the 20% cut in the last two years, we were unable to give salaries, organise capacity building, training programmes and workshops all over India and the overall HIV/AIDS control programme had been hit,"" added the SACS official."

"May 28, 2016, 10:15 IST",Russian activists struggle to raise HIV awareness as epidemic grows,"

  MOSCOW: , stunned hundreds of students at a conference in Moscow last week when he reached into his pocket and took out a condom.
  
  ,
  ""And you, the young generation, how do you protect yourselves from HIV?"" said Pokrovsky, the 61-year-old head of Russia's federal , centre.
  ,
  ,
  ""I always have a condom on me. Today even a 90-year-old can contract the virus.""
  ,
  ,
  The audience fell silent for a moment before breaking into applause.
  ,
  ,
  Despite the efforts of activists like Pokrovsky, the total number of registered HIV cases in Russia exceeded one million in late 2015, with authorities struggling to contain an epidemic that experts say could be curbed by increased funding and more awareness campaigns.
  ,
  ,
  Pokrovsky has been openly critical of the Kremlin's policies promoting traditional family values, saying they have failed to halt the spread of the deadly virus.
  ,
  ""In 2015 alone, some 100,000 new HIV cases were reported in Russia,"" Pokrovsky told AFP.
  ,
  ,
  ""This is a very high rate, maybe the highest in Europe.""
  ,
  ,
  The Russian government's policy focuses on treatment while neglecting prevention drives such as sex education in schools, with the number of people infected with the virus soaring as a result, say experts.
  ,
  ,
  A public health campaign in Moscow last year urged people to be faithful to their partners, rather than promoting condom use.
  ,
  ,
  ""Young people here often don't even know what HIV is and don't understand its dangers,"" said Moscow-based student Darya Belimova who joined Pokrovsky to address more than a thousand young people at the conference.
  ,
  ,
  The gathering was part of the ""Stop HIV/AIDS"" prevention campaign spanning more than 200 universities.
  ,
  ,
  Although the Russian health and education ministries support ""Stop HIV/AIDS"", activists and volunteers say they are fighting a lonely battle against Russia's , as the virus increasingly affects the heterosexual population.
  ,
  ,
  The World Health Organization last year said that Russia accounted for 60 percent of all HIV diagnoses in Europe in 2014, with heterosexual sex the main route of transmission of the virus which is spread through contact with contaminated body fluids.
  ,
  ,
  The number of HIV-positive minors which stood at 9,792 in 2015 has also jumped 8.5 percent compared to the previous year.
  ,
  ,
  In most of these cases an HIV-positive mother transmitted the virus to the child at birth, said Pokrovsky.
  ,
  ,
  ""In Russia, there is not enough public financing to support the fight against HIV at a national scale, and HIV prevention programmes for drug addicts practically don't exist,"" he said.
  ,
  ,
  There are just a few dozen NGOs working to fight the epidemic, spread across 40 Russian cities.
  ,
  ,
  ""For Russia, this is a very small number,"" Pokrovsky said.
  ,
  ,
  Organizations like the Andrey Rylkov Foundation which runs an outreach programme for drug users in Moscow, handing out clean needles and condoms receive no government funding.
  ,
  ,
  The vast size of the country also presents a challenge for effective prevention, with far-flung corners of the federation like Siberia particularly badly affected.
  ,
  ,
  Russia also bans methadone replacement therapy for drug addicts, which would allow users to avoid injections, eliminating the risk of contracting the virus from contaminated syringes.
  ,
  ,
  Many Russian NGOs, including those working on HIV prevention among drug addicts, have been under increased pressure since the reelection of President Vladimir Putin to a third term in 2012.
  ,
  ,
  Shortly after he was sworn in once again, the government passed a law allowing authorities to brand groups engaging in broadly-defined ""political activity"" that receive foreign funding as ""foreign agents"".
  ,
  ,
  The legislation was passed soon after huge anti-Putin protests rocked Moscow, and Kremlin critics see the law as a way to muzzle the strongman's critics and tighten his grip on power.
  ,
  ,
  In April, a court ordered that Sotsium, an HIV prevention NGO based in the southwestern city of Saratov, be labelled ""foreign agents"" after it received 1.5 million rubles ($22,400) in foreign funding to conduct a survey among drug addicts and people with HIV.
  ,
  ,
  ""Until recently, society wasn't really aware of the magnitude of the problem,"" said Sergei Smirnov, vice-chair of the Foundation for Social and Cultural Initiatives, the organization behind the ""Stop HIV/AIDS"" campaign.
  ,
  ,
  If the growth of HIV infections remains steady until 2021, Russia will face a so-called ""generalized epidemic,"" the foundation warns.
  ,
  ,
  An epidemic becomes ""generalized"" when HIV prevalence exceeds one percent in pregnant women nationwide, Pokrovsky said.
  ,
  ,
  ""This rate now stands at 0.8 percent,"" he said. ""But if it increases, the risk of a serious epidemic is very high.""

Gyan Ranjan of the Network attributes her death to denial of surgery for her abdomen-related complaint despite the media highlighting her story., , Sources said the government ordered a probe into her death, but the probe panel found no one guilty., , It, however, recommended that patients with HIV be operated in government hospitals every Saturday. The idea was that the OTs after such surgeries would be properly fumigated the next day being a Sunday before being used for surgeries on non-HIV patients on Monday onwards till Friday., , Asked if PMCH had slotted a specific day for surgeries on patients with HIV, PMCH superintendent Dr Lakhindra Prasad replied in the negative. He, however, told TOI earlier this week, ""Surgeries are performed on patients with HIV as and when required."", , Persons with HIV apart, even their children remain a neglected lot., , All persons with HIV and their children are given anti-retroviral drugs to prevent the virus in their body from multiplying. Children are prescribed special drugs for the purpose. However, many ART centres have reported non-availability of these drugs with them., , Sources on Thursday told TOI the drugs for such children are out of stock at the ART (anti-retroviral therapy) centres at Darbhanga Medical College & Hospital in Darbhanga and Anugrah Narain Magdh Medical College & Hospital in Gaya. At the government medical college and hospital in Bhagalpur, only 15 days' stock is left., , Experts say this can be dangerous. ""Missing the dose leads to further weakening of the immune system... Also, the virus could become stronger than the drug whenever it is given next,"" said Dr Diwakar Tejaswi, former member of the Bihar State Aids Control Society (BSACS)., , Senior BSACS official B Gupta admits the shortage of drugs. ""We are not getting supplies from the National Aids Control Organisation (NACO). We are managing things by supplying drugs from one centre to another,"" Gupta told TOI on Thursday., , However, NACO's national programme officer B B Rewari blamed it on the state.

"Updated: Jun 2, 2016, 10:12 IST,PCR could be a more accurate test for HIV, says NIRRH consultant (btrenkel/Getty Images)","PCR could be a more accurate test for HIV, says NIRRH consultant","

  Amid concerns of , transmission through infected blood, a premier research institute in the city has revealed that they came across two rare cases where the most commonly used HIV ,, ELISA, could not detect the virus for up to two years. The finding assumes significance as most blood banks, hospitals and transfusion centres use , as a , standard to detect HIV.
  
  The virus in the two city women could finally be detected using the , that is occasionally used to test HIV. The Parel-based National Institute for Research in Reproductive Health (NIRRH) had come across the cases in 2012, when the women were referred from JJ Hospital with a history of co-infection.
  ,
  ,
  The revelation comes within days of the National Aids Control Organisation (NACO) stating that 2,234 people have contracted HIV across the country through transfusion of infected blood in the past one-and-a-half years. In Maharashtra, 276 people have got HIV through infected blood.
  ,
  ,
  The point here is not to say that ELISA is unreliable but that there is a possibility of missing out infected bility of missing out infected cases. In both cases, the antibodies did not appear for two years,"" said Dr Atmaram Bandivadekar, consultant at NIRRH. HIV antibodies are generated by the body's immune system when under attack from the virus. Tests like ELISA check for the presence of antibodies to say if a person is infected or not.
  ,
  ,
  ""Different individuals can take varying time to generate antibodies, but two years is too long,"" he said. Bandivadekar said that PCR could be a more accurate alternative. ""This test finds either the RNA of the HIV virus or the HIV DNA in cells infected with the virus. The test can be done within days of exposure as one does not have to worry about the window period,"" he added. In an ELISA test, there is a window period of one to three months depending on whether the technology is from the first or fourth generation.
  ,
  ,
  The husbands of both these women were HIV positive and were taking the antiretro viral therapy at JJ Hospital.Doctors at the hospital became curious when the women frequently came with some ailment despite repeatedly testing negative for HIV .
  ,
  ,
  They stopped following up with the institute after two years.
  ,
  ,
  But staunch ELISA supporters are not willing to write off the test yet. ""It has been proved beyond doubt that this test has a low chance of giving a false result after the first few weeks that a person is infected.The world over, it is the first line of screening. If ELISA is negative, other tests are not usually repeated,"" said a microbiologist. Though if ELISA comes positive, the test is repeated to confirm the findings.""PCR may be reliable but it is expensive and needs expertise,"" the doctor added.
  ,
  ,
  Bandivadekar felt all blood banks should have the PCR technology. Dr Shrikala Acharya, additional project director of the Mumbai District Aids Control Society (,), said there are cost and operational issues that have to be considered. An ELISA test in a private lab costs up to Rs 650, whereas a PCR test may cost over Rs 2,500.

The country went from 100,000 HIV cases in 1990 to more than a million three years later, fuelled in part by its huge sex trade.,Health workers initially struggled to persuade governments to act.,But an eventual push to distribute free condoms among sex workers throughout the late 1990s and the widespread rollout of antiretroviral drugs in the 2000s has seen huge success and won the country widespread praise.,""Thailand's progress shows how much can be achieved when science and medicine are underpinned by sustained political commitment,"" UNAIDS Executive Director Michel Sidibe said in a statement.,But there is still work to be done. The UN estimates there are some 500,000 living with HIV in the kingdom, while infection rates have risen slightly in recent years, particularly among gay men.,Piyasakol Sakolsatayadorn, Thailand's Minister of Public Health, said the landmark announcement ""belongs to everyone"" but added ""a challenge remains: how we make this success sustainable."",Each year, 1.4 million women living with HIV around the world become pregnant.

She went through the mandatory blood tests before surgery and everything was fine barring a low haemoglobin level. A blood transfusion done at the hospital to improve her platelet count, however, changed the course of her life for the worse.,Though she was not operated upon in that period, she was given one unit of blood and asked to come back in five days by which time the Hb percentage was expected to improve. What followed came as a total shock. Subsequently, when Gowri came back for admission and after another round of blood tests, the results said: Reactive to HIV 1. And the interpretation was screaming: ""The above sample was repeatedly reactive for HIV I and II antibodies by three different test methods and therefore positive for HIV as per NACO guidelines."",The family was caught unawares. Not even a week prior to this second blood test, her sample showed HIV negative, in the same laboratory, of the same hospital. The hospital, which denied the allegations, reportedly told the family that Gowri was already infected before she came to them. ,It's been two years since her diagnosis and Gowri is on medication; her family has approached the Karnataka Medical Council and is fighting a case in the magistrate's court. The issue was brought before the state health department, and a committee was formed, but it did not see any action. A petition moved by V S Ugrappa, chairman of the expert committee on preventing sexual violence against women and children, has set the ball rolling with the police taking up the case.,The complaint was filed recently at Sadashivnagar police station against the hospital, a gynaecologist, and two employees of the Integrated Counselling and Testing Center for cognisable offence of ""forgery with medical records and medical negligence"".,""It is submitted that the accused hospital is involved in gross medical negligence by causing HIV infection via contaminated blood transfusion. Thereafter, the accused have tampered with the medical records to cover up the crime. The chain of events shows that within all human probability, the offence of forgery of medical records to conceal evidence of medical negligence. This complaint may be specially taken in record and speedily acted upon, because of the gravity of the crime, the maneuvers of the other side to hush up matters and cause great harm to me and my family,'' the complaint has stated.,The major offences recorded are: Forgery of medical record (IPC section 466); cheating (420); forgery (463), making a false document (464). Subsequently, the police have taken up an FIR and investigations are on -- they are examining the medical records and have questioned the hospital staff and the doctor.,Documents show that on February 13, 2014, Gowri was admitted to the hospital and discharged on the 15th. Her discharge summary says that her Hb% is 7.5m, platelet count 2.29; VDRL, HIV I & II negative and one unit of blood transfusion was advised. Accordingly, on the 14th, one unit (300 ml of RBC) was given (blood unit number 17093 for which the family has the record) and on the 15th she was discharged and asked to come back on the 19th.,Subsequently, on February 19, Gowri was again admitted and the same set of blood tests were carried out. And this time the results were: Hb% 10.2, platelet count 2.23 and HIV I & II negative (in fact it is very unclear and looks like a scribble). The discharge summary read: ""Patient came with the above mentioned complaints, diagnosed to be Retro Positive and counseling done. Hence discharged on February 22.'' Surprisingly, the blood unit number was changed to 12093 in the hospital records.,The patient gave another sample for testing at the Integrated Counselling and Testing Center on February 24 which also showed her positive for HIV. Intriguingly, the same Center has another record to show that on February 12, Gowri's sample was tested and came back HIV positive. But the catch is that Gowri was admitted to MS Ramaiah only on February 13, hence where did this blood test come from. The family sees something amiss., ,""This is a fraudulent document. When my sister was admitted on 13th and her blood sample drawn for testing at MS Ramaiah, why would she go for blood tests on the 12th? This document was created subsequently to show that the patient was infected before she was admitted. But the hospital's first discharge summary says that the blood tests are negative for HIV. This has to be investigated thoroughly,'' said the patient's husband Rajanna (name changed).,MS Ramaiah Hospital termed the issue an ""allegation"" and its chief administrator Dr V Narendranath, who did not want to divulge much on the case, said, ""It is in court and it is sub judice. We will respond to the court and give a reply to the appropriate authority. We respect our patients and we cannot divulge the patient's medical history. We will not breach the patient's confidentiality at any cost."" Expressing his resentment over the police ""harassing the doctors and para-medical staff for four days"", Dr Narendranath says: ""Why is this a criminal case? These days, hospitals have become a soft target. Every patient has a right to express his/her grievance and somebody has to decide what is right and what is wrong."" ,For a start, MS Ramaiah Hospital doesn't come under the state government's Individual Donor Nucleic Acid Testing (ID-NAT) project where blood is tested at the highest standard. The normal process followed for testing of donated blood in private blood banks in hospitals is the Elisa test, which detects Hepatitis B and C and HIV for antigens and antibodies. However, under ID-NAT, the blood sample is tested for HIV, HBV (Hepatitis B) and HCV (Hepatitis C) to detect direct Ribo Nucleic Acid and DNA of the virus. All government hospital bloodbanks and Rotary-TTK are a part of this project where donated blood is mandatorily tested by ID-NAT. This test is done at Bowring Hospital, the only certified blood testing facility.,According to specialists, a virus, after entering the bloodstream, has a window period and only after that can the antigens or antibodies be detected. HIV has a lower window period than HBV or HCV -- around 15-20 days. In case an HIV-infected person donates blood and the window period is just four to five days, the virus will go undetected and there is a fair chance that it could infect the person undergoing the blood transfusion."

  ,
  The family of the patient said the local hospitals they approached had given up, saying there was no cure for this complex condition. So, they rushed him to Delhi where the transplant was carried out.
  ,
  ,
  ""It took us over 10 hours to carry out the life-saving procedure. We had to be very careful not to catch the infection. At the same time, we had to ensure that the patient didn't contract any infection post transplant,"" said Dr Naimish Mehta, senior liver transplant surgeon at SGRH.
  ,
  ,
  He said HIV patients are generally not taken up for major surgeries, particularly transplants, because they are immune-compromised.
  ,
  ,
  ""In this case, for example, the patient had both HIV and Hepatitis C, which compromised his immunity significantly. Additionally, we had to suppress his immune system post transplant to ensure that the body doesn't reject the new liver,"" Mehta said.

  The liver transplant surgeon said both the donor and the recipient were doing well.

  In India, 2.1 million people are living with HIV and Hepatitis C virus co-infection, said Dr Anil Arora, chairman, department of gastroenterology at the hospital.
  ,

  He added that initially HIV infection was considered an absolute contraindication for organ transplants because of concerns about disease progression.

  ,
  However, with recent advances in retro-viral therapy for HIV and treatment for Hepatitis C virus infection, complex procedures, including transplants, can be carried out, the doctor added.

  For the uninitiated, there are five different types of viral hepatitis, namely A, B, C, D and E. All of them are contagious and some are life threatening too. Hepatitis A and E are waterborne; Hepatitis B, C and D are transmitted by bodily fluids (via syringes, needles, injections, toothbrush, razors). Furthermore, all of them are contagious and some are life threatening too.
  ,
  ,
  Dr. Ajay P Choksi, Consultant and Head, Dept. of Gastroenterology & Hepatology at Nanavati Super Speciality Hospital, Mumbai explains, ""Hepatitis A and E are generally self limiting and don't normally last beyond six months. However, they can be severe, incapacitating and fatal during this period. Hepatitis B (HBV) and C (HBC), on the other hand, can give rise to acute illnesses like A (HBA) and E (HBE) but can also cause chronic liver disease, which can lead to cirrhosis of liver or even cancer of liver. Hepatitis D (HBD) infection occurs only if a person has Hepatitis B.""
  ,
  ,
  Shockingly, there have been a surge in deaths in the past 20 years. ""Despite alarming statistics, we as a country have not undertaken enough clinical research. Of the five, there is no cure for three of them. Hepatitis C alone affects estimated 12 million people in India, most of whom don't even know they are carriers. The combined burden of viral hepatitis is huge in India. We need treatment regimens that are short and therapies that are effective, affordable and well-tolerated,"" shares Suneela Thatte, President, Indian Society of Clinical Research (ISCR).
  ,
  ,
   , has stated that a shocking 95 per cent of people infected with Hepatitis B or C do not even know they are infected and often live without symptoms for a long time. This year alone, 10 to 30 million people will be infected with HBV. Dr Harshwardhan Dongre, K J Somaiya Hospital warns, ""Currently there is no treatment for acute Hepatitis B infection. Progression to chronic disease depends on a host of factors, so preventing acute infection is the only preventive measure available."" Dr. PM Bhujang - President, Association of Hospitals adds, ""Acute infection may present as fever, loss of appetite, nausea and vomiting fever, abdominal pain, jaundice and dark urine. Chronic hepatitis may present with early and late symptoms of liver dysfunction and failure.""
  ,
  ,
  Unlike Hepatitis B, C and D, Hepatitis A and E do not damage the liver in the long term. ""Once infected or vaccinated, we do not get the infection again,"" adds Dr Vasudevan K R, senior consultant, surgical gastroenterology and liver transplantation department, Jaypee Hospital, Noida.
  ,
  ,
  ,
  ,
  ,
  Most of the viral hepatitis have vaccinations and so the first plan should be to get yourself duly immunized against them. Follow the below guidelines:
  ,
  ,
  - Avoid sharing sharp objects for example, needles, razor and toothbrush.
  ,
  ,
  - Avoid unprotected sex.
  ,
  ,
  - Three dosages of hepatitis B vaccine given at intervals of 0-1-6 months would give immunity against Hepatitis B at more than 95% probability.
  ,
  ,
  - All infants should be immunised against hepatitis B in 1st year of life.
  ,
  ,
  - All pregnant ladies should be screened for hepatitis B & C and if found positive, adequate measures should be taken to prevent transmission.
  ,
  ,
  - No open wound should be contacted without gloves.

  Ninety percent of infected adults with acute hepatitis B can recover without any problems, but most infected babies and children eventually develop chronic hepatitis B infection, where recovery is not possible. New antiviral treatments may reduce the incidence of complications by suppressing the virus and preventing progression of the disease.
  ,
  ,
  ,
  ,
  The Viral Hepatitis B vaccine is absolutely safe and extremely effective. It only takes 3 shots to protect against viral hepatitis B.

  No vaccine currently exists for hepatitis C therefore you cannot be vaccinated for hepatitis C.

"Updated: Jul 29, 2016, 09:55 IST,74% male sex workers in Chennai at risk of HIV: Study (Jamie Lords/Getty Images)",74% male sex workers in Chennai at risk of HIV: Study,"

  They are told their orientation is unnatural, their profession criminal and their existence precarious yet outreach programmes for them are minimal. Although male , (MSWs) come under the high-risk category under , intervention programmes, their names rarely make it to the list. The result is more than 25 years after the initiation of the country's AIDS control programme, most of them continue to engage in unsafe sex.
  
  ,
  A , by a group of researchers from institutes across the world, including the , (NIRT), Chennai, has found that 74.2% of the MSWs they surveyed accepted more money from their clients to not use a condom. The study, recently published in AIDS Care, took into account experiences of 100 , around the age of 25 years in the city. Beena Thomas, an , scientist, who was part of the research, said at least three-fourth of the subjects surveyed expressed difficulty in convincing their clients to use condoms. ""They find it hard to negotiate. And if sex work is their only source of income, it is likely that they agree to go forward without protection as the clients pay more,"" she said. The subjects said they earned between `2,000 and `8,000 a month.
  ,
  ,
  Although male sex workers are at a higher risk of contracting HIV and sexually transmitted infections (STI), they remain understudied compared to their female peers. Experts attribute this to the stigma attached not just to sex work, but their sexual orientation as well.
  ,
  ,
  The study also noted that only 64% of them reported ever testing for HIV. Dr Sundar Sundararaman, a physician who has worked with HIV patients for the past 30 years, isn't surprised by these figures. He said while HIV intervention programmes have listed transgender, women sex workers and homosexual men under the high-risk category, they are yet to recognize male sex workers as an exclusive group. ""Male sex workers are not identified and so they aren't in the ambit of service delivery ,"" he said, advocating changes at the policy level. He said financial incentives for riskier sexual behaviour, coupled with lack of access to prevention services, increased prevalence of HIV and STIs among MSWs compared to broader population of men having sex with men. The study also noted that more than half of the subjects did not know the HIV status of their most recent client.
  ,
  ,
  As believed, it is not just women sex workers who face abuse. Researchers found 60% of the MSWs faced verbal abuse and 40% were physically assaulted. Those who financially depended only on sex work were far more vulnerable and likely to report abuse.
  ,
  ,
  Dr Vijaya Raman of Tamil Nadu AIDS Initiative said the numbers were alarming and urgent steps needed to be taken for intervention programmes to reach this group. ""Our outreach programmes need to be revamped. This is an evolving sector. Previously , they operated in groups, now many of them work individually through the internet, which gives them anonymity,"" he said.
  ,
  ,
  The study threw another surprise highlighting the need to identify this group -nearly 72% said they wanted to continue sex work. ""This being the case, HIV prevention interventions shouldn't try to draw MSWs away but focus on facilitating skills that will support their ability to negotiate sexual safety,"" said Thomas.

"Updated: Sep 1, 2016, 11:57 IST,Dearth of infrastructure and manpower at blood banks are additional challenges.",85 turn HIV+ due to blood transfusion in last 3 years,"

  Mumbai's , control body, in an RTI, has revealed that 85 people were infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) while getting , in the last three years. The numbers, though based on voluntary disclosure of clients visiting , testing centres, have raised serious concerns about safety and testing protocols at blood banks in the city.
  
  ,
  The RTI response by the Mumbai District Aids Control Society (MDACS) shows that 18 got HIV through infected blood in 2015-16. The infections more than doubled (42) in 2014-15. In 2013-14, 25 infections were attributed to blood transfusion.The disclosure came as the National Aids Control Organization (NACO) claimed that transfusion-transmitted infections are largely restricted to rural areas with limited medical infrastructure.
  ,
  ,
  Government agencies fighting HIV in the city are clueless about the source of the untested blood. ""We were told there is no mechanism to trace the source of the infected blood or find out which bank supplied it.It is a worrying situation,"" said Chetan Kothari, who filed the RTI. The numbers were collated from integrated counselling and testing centres (ICTC) at all major public hospitals of the city. MDACS said only a miniscule percentage of HIV , in the city are caused by infected blood. ""The heterosexual route is still responsible for more than 90% infections. Out of the 8,000odd cases detected in the city annually, only 0.02% is attributable to blood transfusion,"" said Dr Shrikala Acharya, additional project director, MDACS.
  ,
  ,
  Activists, however, felt blood banks have a major role to play. ""As per rules, when a donor turns out to be HIV positive, heshe must be informed and referred to the centres. But most blood banks don't do it,"" said an employee of a leading blood bank who has been advocating safe blood. He insisted the blood donor, unaware of his status, continues to donate blood. ""If he is within the 3-6month window, the ELISA test used to check blood in most banks won't be able to detect the virus,"" he said.
  ,
  ,
  Therefore, a huge emphasis should be on pre-donor counselling. ""A detailed history of the donor before blood donation, where they are asked open questions about their lifestyles, can significantly bring down infection. But, unfortunately, at most blood camps, it is looked at as a waste of time,"" said Dr Zarine Bharucha, chairperson, Federation of Bombay Blood Banks (FBBB).
  ,
  ,
  Dearth of infrastructure and manpower at blood banks are additional challenges. A pathologist told TOI there is a staff shortage at most banks. ""Blood is not tested for days or there is shortage of kits. This can lead to false negativity or positivity,"" the doctor said.

"Sep 17, 2016, 15:43 IST",Fear of having HIV among the most common phobias in Kolkata,"

  KOLKATA: A technician's fatal fall to escape an Alsatian has opened up the discussion on the different kinds of phobias that Kolkatans are suffering from. While fear of dogs, lizards and mathematics are very common, city-based psychiatrists admit to coming across more extreme and sometimes weird cases. From homophobia to scare of having ,, from worry over not having mobile connectivity to fear of being touched - a large number of Kolkatans are experiencing all of these and even more. Some are even tweaking around with their lifestyle to deal with their fear.
  
  ,
  A very common , that doctors have reported is the fear of having HIV. A small cut in a salon is enough to trigger it. Some of these patients don't just live with the fear. They even go to the extent of getting HIV tests done. Sometimes, the tests are done repeatedly. Dissatisfied with repeated negative HIV tests, general physicians then refer them to psychiatrists. ""They live with this fear despite having done the tests. Some also have similar phobia about having swine flu,"" said psychiatrist Dr Jairanjan Ram.
  ,
  ,
  Psychiatrist Dr Abir Mukherjee has also come across this phobia. Mukherjee makes a distinction between obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) and phobia. According to him persons with OCD experience persistent recurrent intrusive thoughts that might result in them avoiding imaginary situations. They might see a drop of blood on the floor and imagine that somehow they will have HIV from it. ""In case of phobia, the person exercises caution in behaviour and might display a tendency to avoid real situations. He might not visit a parlour for fear of 'contacting' HIV,"" Mukherjee explained, also mentioning cases of patients suffering from fear of mosquito bites and earthquakes.
  ,
  ,
  The increasing depending on mobile phones has led to the rise of nomophobia or the fear of no mobile connectivity because of network or battery charge issues. An investment banker from this city recently cut short his four-day vacation for river rafting because there was no mobile connectivity. Anil Punjabi, chairman (east) of the Travel Agents' Federation of India, has noticed how this fear among tourists has had them change their travel plans. ""Recently parents didn't give permission to their children to go out camping to a place where there was no mobile connectivity."" Fear of not having WiFi has also gone up.
  ,
  ,
  Adding to this list is the pathological fear of contamination and germs or mysophobia. Psychologist , came across a patient who just didn't want to touch the doorknobs. ""She would wait for someone to offer assistance to help her open the doors. She is undergoing cognitive behavioural therapy to overcome this,"" she said.
  ,
  ,
  Fear of being touched or haphephobia is an issue with many teenagers. ""This often occurs when a child has a history of sexual abuse. I remember a teenager who had turned violent. After some sessions, I found that his violent behaviour was his defence mechanism because he feared anyone touching him. So even a pat on his back was problematic. Later it was detected that as a child his parent would get violent with him and those memories had an impact on his behavioural patterns,"" Singh said, adding that she has also come across cases of necrophobia or the fear of losing a dear one to death.
  ,
  ,
  Fear of taking flights is common among Kolkatans. Mukherjee recalls a top executive who had come for counselling because he just couldn't go for air travel. He even missed out on promotions because he couldn't go for overseas trip. After graded exposure and systematic desensitization, he was able to overcome the fear, fly overseas and get his promotion too. ""Agoraphobia is also common,"" said Mukherjee. It is an anxiety disorder characterized by symptoms of anxiety in situations where the person perceives the environment to be unsafe with no easy way to get away. ""The problem can be so acute that they even fear to go anywhere alone,"" Mukherjee added.
  ,
  ,
  Homophobia, psychiatrists insist, is also quite common. ""Because of this fear, some have even approached me with strange requests to conduct tests to ascertain if they are bisexual or homosexual,"" Ram said.
  ,
  ,
  But what is even more curious in this city is that many closet homosexuals also display this homophobia. Choreographer , remembers one incident at a party where a much-married man was openly abusing homosexuals. ""Much later, when I interacted with him on a one-on-one basis, he started flirting with me. Being macho in front of the world was his defence mechanism to announce that he isn't gay,"" Chakraborty said. According to Chakraborty, at least 60 per cent of gay men in Kolkata live dual lives and many among them are homophobes too in public.

  LONDON: , are on the verge of confirming a treatment for HIV, an incurable virus that leads to deadly , disease, if a new treatment trial proves successful, a media report claimed on Sunday.
  
  ,
  A British man with HIV hopes to become the first in the world to be cured of the disease by using the pioneering new therapy designed to eradicate the virus, 'The Sunday Times' reported.
  ,
  ,
  The 44-year-old is the first of 50 people to complete a trial of the ambitious treatment, designed by scientists and doctors from five of Britain's leading universities - universities of Oxford, Cambridge, Imperial College London, University College London and King's College London.
  ,
  ,
  It is the first therapy created to track down and destroy HIV in every part of the body — including in the dormant cells that evade current treatments.
  ,
  ,
  If successful, it offers hope of an irreversible cure for HIV and could save millions of pounds spent on drugs.
  ,
  ,
  Early tests show the virus is undetectable in the man's blood.
  ,
  ,
  But he will have to wait some months before confirmation on whether the treatment has permanently cleared the disease.
  ,
  ,
  It is possible that the absence of the virus could be down to the conventional drugs that he has also been taking which can temporarily clear the body of the disease.
  ,
  ,
  Mark Samuels, managing director of the National Institute for Health Research Office for Clinical Research Infrastructure, which set up the medical consortium, told the newspaper: ""This is one of the first serious attempts at a full cure for HIV. We are exploring the real possibility of curing HIV. This is a huge challenge and it's still early days but the progress has been remarkable.""
  ,
  ,
  The , is mostly transmitted by sex. Once in the body it targets T-cells, part of the immune system, splicing itself into their DNA. If the T-cell is active the HIV hijacks it, turning it into a tiny factory spewing millions more viruses to infect other T-cells.
  ,
  ,
  It is this aspect of HIV activity that is targeted and suppressed by anti-retroviral therapies (ART). What ART cannot do is pick out the millions of infected T-cells lying dormant around the body -- but waiting to spring into life should ART fail. It is the HIV reservoir in these dormant cells that the research group is targeting.
  ,
  ,
  ""It would be great if a cure has happened. My last blood test was a couple of weeks ago and there is no detectable virus. However, that could be the anti-retroviral therapies, so we have to wait to be sure,"" the London-based patient said.
  ,
  ,
  The new trial is being backed by the UK's state-funded , (NHS) because it could save millions by removing the need to treat HIV patients with ART, which costs around 380,000 pounds per person over their lifetime.

  CHENNAI: Men who were sexually abused by other men when they were children are prone to initiating same-sex encounters, says a study. This puts them at greater risk of ,.
  
  ,
  The study, undertaken by a team from Johns Hopkins School of Public Health, covered 11,700 men who have sex with men (MSM) in 12 districts, including Chennai. It found that close to 23% of gender non-conforming boys were victimised by older trusted men, which pushed them to engage in HIV-risk behaviour later in life.
  ,
  ,
  Epidemiologist Sunil Solomon, who was part of the research, said when the team set out to study the burden of HIV among MSM, several participants they surveyed shared their sexual experiences as children. ""What troubled us was that many of them described it as experience, not realizing they were survivors of abuse. They thought it was natural, which only further marginalized them,"" said Solomon.
  ,
  ,
  A kothi (effeminate man) in Chennai recalled his uncle molesting him when he was three. ""I didn't know what he was doing,"" the study quoted him as saying. Later in life, he tested positive for HIV.
  ,
  ,
  ""I didn't tell anyone what happened to me. When they (his family) scold me (for having HIV), I want to say `You should have taken care when I was young. I am alone now'.""
  ,
  ,
  ,
  ,
  ,
  According to official estimates, men who have sex with men have a 12-14 times higher prevalence of HIV than other men.
  ,
  ,
  The study found that the prevalence of child sexual abuse was higher among ""gender non-conforming men"" than the general population, which also increased their vulnerability to HIV.
  ,
  ,
  They found that those who had a history of abuse had approximately 2.5 times more lifetime male sexual partners compared to those without and the HIV prevalence was almost double in the former group.
  ,
  ,
  Child sexual abuse in general has been identified as an important predictor of high-risk sexual behaviour later in life for both men and women, including early sexual debut, unprotected sex, multiple partners, and engagement in transactional sex, which increases the risk of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections.
  ,
  ,
  A study by UNICEF, covering 13 states, found that more than half of children (53%) reported abuse, with the prevalence being higher for boys than girls (53% and 23% respectively).
  ,
  ,
  The study found the prevalence of child sexual abuse among the group to be the highest in Tamil Nadu where 43.2% of the participants claimed they were sexually abused, with Coimbatore having the highest at 70.2%. In Chennai, 34.3% said they were abused. Experts say the prevalence is probably high in the south because of better reporting.
  ,
  ,
  Child rights and LGBT activists say the study has highlighted the need for more intervention programmes for boys who have been victims of abuse.
  ,
  ,
  ""While abuse is generally high among children, the prevalence is exceptionally high among gender nonconforming boys. They are already grappling with being different from how the society describes their gender. Abuse just makes things tougher,"" said Dr L Ramakrishnan, country director, SAATHI, an organisation that works on HIV/AIDS.

  A British man could become the first person in the world to be cured of , using a new therapy designed by a team of scientists from five UK universities.
  
  The therapy is combining standard antiretroviral drugs with another one that reactivates dormant HIV and a vaccine that induces the immune system to destroy the infected cells. Antiretoviral drugs alone are highly effective at stopping the virus from reproducing but do not eradicate the disease, so must be taken for life.

  The 44-year-old Briton is the first among 50 people to complete a trial of the treatment, designed by scientists and doctors from Oxford, Cambridge, Imperial College, University College London and King's College.

  HIV is able to hide from the immune system in dormant cells where sophisticated testing cannot find it, and therefore resist therapy . The treatment endeavours to trick the virus into emerging from its hiding places and then trigger the body's immune system to recognise it and attack it, an approach that has been called ""kick and kill"". The new therapy works in two stages. Firstly ,a vaccine helps the body recognise the HIV-infected cells so it can clear them out. Secondly, a new drug called Vorinostat activates the dormant Tcells so they can be spotted by the immune system.

"Sushmi Dey,Nov 22, 2016, 06:48 IST",HIV|AIDS bill to be tabled in RS during winter session,"

  NEW DELHI: In a move to grant stronger protection to the country's HIV community, the government plans to introduce the HIV and AIDS (Prevention and Control) , in , during the ongoing winter session. The bill seeks to end discrimination and ensure equality for people living with HIV.
  
  ,
  The bill, which was approved by the , last month, seeks to bring legal accountability to prohibit discrimination against the HIV community and instead promotes equality while accessing healthcare, acquiring jobs, renting houses or in educational institutions in the public and private sectors. The bill failed to be introduced in the , on Monday because of protests over the government's demonetisation move.
  ,
  ,
  There are approximately 21 lakh persons estimated to be living with HIV in India and the percentage of patients receiving anti-retro viral therapy treatment currently stands at a mere 25.82% as against the global percentage of 41%.
  ,
  ,
  The key provisions in the bill include establishment of a formal mechanism to probe complaints against those who discriminate against such people. This will allow individuals as well as families that have faced discrimination to go to court against institutions or persons being unfair. The bill also lists various grounds on which discrimination against HIV positive people and those living with them is prohibited. For instance, the list includes the denial, termination, discontinuation or unfair treatment with regard to employment, educational establishments, healthcare services, residing or renting property , standing for public or private office, and provision of insurance.

"Rachel Chitra,Nov 24, 2016, 05:31 IST",Startups help HIV patients access affordable healthcare,"

  CHENNAI: For 32-year-old Anand Natrajan* the biggest shocker of his life came when he realised he had tested positive for HIV.
  
  ,
  Since he lived in a village, 32 km from ,, every visit to the private hospital was agony. Detection, followed by shame and ostracization was what he feared.
  ,
  ,
  Plagued by many doubts - Will my children get HIV? What if I get weaker and cannot work? Anand is not alone, there are many like him who want such questions answered. Coming to their rescue are a host of startups, which offer hope and promises to improve the manageability of such conditions.
  ,
  ,
  Online pharmacists are proving useful to such patients, who have chronic conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, HIV, asthma, cancer as buying online has its plus points like bulk orders, discounts of 15%-20% to manage their daily dependence on drugs.
  ,
  ,
  But for patients with HIV, it helps them overcome social stigma, as their purchases remain a secret.
  ,
  ,
  ""There is no human interface, which is a huge comfort factor to some people. We cater to many remote villages in India and people can order in bulk for three-five months and a discreet package arrives at their doorsteps. We also send out refill reminders two-three weeks ahead of time,"" Pradeep Dadha, CEO, Netmeds, which got $50 million in funding from a group of investors, including US-based investment firm OrbiMed and MAPE Advisory. .
  ,
  ,
  Apart from pharmacists, telemedicine startups like Rxpress, Karma, Olito, Quadia Technoligies are also helping people with HIV access affordable healthcare from remote, rural locations. ""Ostracisation is a huge fear and with the increase of telemedicine platforms, people are able to better access doctors,"" said ,, founder of Rajasthan-based Karma Healthcare, which got undisclosed funding from Austria-based Ennovent Impact Investment Holding.
  ,
  ,
  ""We ensure privacy and boost self-confidence. Apart from medical problems, people also want a morale boost - Will I able to work? Will I grow weaker? What if I had an open wound and used a towel?"" said ,, CEO, Rxpress, which has 12,000 registered customers.
  ,
  ,
  In rural areas, since patients travel long distances for doctor's consultations, sometimes there is a gap of 6-7 months before the next visit. ""Patients need to be educated on the need for strict medical adherence and the side-effects of anti-retrovirals. Since there is a lot of conflicting information about , online, patients find it useful that they can come to us,"" said Gopal.
  ,
  ,
  Many patients confuse HIV with communicable diseases like jaundice and chicken pox. So the around-the-clock availability of doctors is another need. At Pune-based Olito, chief executive Rajesh Kumar Singh said that they get the most number of calls in the night and the early hours of the morning.

"SEETHALAKSHMI S and Sreemoyee Chatterjee,Updated: Nov 27, 2016, 06:06 IST",6-year-old brother saves thalassemic HIV-infected boy,"

  BENGALURU: Sachin (name changed) was just a few months old when he was diagnosed with thalassemia major; he needed , once in three to four weeks for his survival. The family had to travel more than 100 km from their home in , and it was a double whammy when they realized the boy had , though one such blood transfusion. However, their recent visit to a , turned things for the better.
  
  ,
  Sachin, now aged 10, is cured of thalassemia after he underwent the bone marrow transplant (BMT) five months ago and his six-year-old brother was the donor. Bone marrow transplant on a patient infected with HIV is ridden with risks and the procedure was a huge challenge for the 100-odd team of doctors and para-medical staff at the Majumdar Shaw Cancer Centre. This is, according to the doctor who treated Sachin, is the second successful case in the world and the first in India. The boy hasn't shown symptoms of HIV for the past five months.
  ,
  ,
  ""We were devastated to know he was contracted with the deadly virus. We approached many transplant centres, but none of them wanted to even touch him,"" said Sachin's father who finally decided to try his luck in Bengaluru.
  ,
  ,
  ""When he came, the boy's immune system was weak and infections were high. I realized that HIV infection could flare up during the transplant. That was the biggest challenge for us. The whole process, including preparing the boy for the surgery, took several weeks. The Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) matched with his sibling, making the transplant possible,"" Dr Sunil Bhat, senior consultant and head of paediatric haematology, oncology and bone marrow transplant at Mazumdar Shaw Cancer Centre, Narayana Health City.
  ,
  ,
  Sachin's HIV infection is now under control and he no longer needs any blood transfusion, he added.
  ,
  ,
  It may be too early to predict, given that the transplant took place just five months ago. But if the boy doesn't show further symptoms of HIV relapse in the next one year, this procedure can be considered as a possible cure for HIV. There's no need to worry about HIV transmission between the bone marrow donor and the recipient; the donor is at no risk of contracting HIV in the process. Sachin's six-year-old brother, the bone marrow donor in this case, is completely healthy

  BENGALURU: , ranks sixth in India in terms of , through ,. According to a study by , (NACO), between January 2015 and May 2016, 127 patients in the , due to inappropriate blood transfusion.
  
  ,
  Out of 184 licensed blood banks in the state, only 66 are NACO certified for safe blood. Going by the report, Uttar Pradesh tops the list with 371 HIV positive cases triggered through blood transfusion, followed by Gujarat (292), Maharashtra (276), New Delhi (264) and West Bengal (135).
  ,
  ,
  Officials at Indian Foundation for Safe Blood (IFSB), an organization that works towards creating awareness about diseases transmitted during blood transfusions, said: ""Globally, 15 % of HIV is transmitted through blood transfusions and in India the rate is extremely alarming. In the past five years, 9,000 people in India got affected by HIV due to blood transfusion. In Chhattisgarh blood transfusion has become a major carrier of AIDS. In Jodhpur, 53 kids were tested positive for Hepatitis C after receiving infected blood. Although better than five other states, Karnataka still doesn't look safe."" Blood transfused without proper checks could result in deadly infections like HIV, Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, Malaria, Syphilis, Dengue and Chikungunya.
  ,
  ,
  Explaining the reasons behind random collection of blood, IFSB officials added: ""Often, shortage of blood leads to unhealthy ways of collecting it. Another problem is non-availability of the exact blood group. Also, only a very small percentage of blood is collected through repeat voluntary blood donors, who are the safest donors. Most of the others are first-time donors who are more likely to transmit infections as they aren't tested in advance. Further, majority of blood is collected through mass blood donation camps which lack proper facilities for screening.""
  ,
  ,
  Asked about ways to tackle the problem, another source from IFSB said, ""The method of testing needs to improve. The Nucleic Acid Testing (NAT) method should be used to detect HIV, Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C. NAT is conducted in two ways --- Mini Pool Nucleic Acid Testing and Individual Donor Nucleic Acid Testing (ID NAT). In the first one, blood samples are pooled together for the purpose of testing. However, there's a disadvantage. Even if one sample contains a virus, the entire batch has to be discarded and each sample tested individually all over again. ID NAT is the best method as it captures the virus itself. Increase in voluntary repeat blood donation, pre-donation health history screening and hemovigilance programme are other ways to address the issue.""
  ,
  ,
  ID NAT method
  ,
  ,
  ID NAT is a conventional method of testing blood. It requires the presence of antibodies to trigger a positive test result. ID NAT is used to detect the low levels of viral genetic material present in the body. However, it happens before the body begins producing antibodies in response to a virus, enabling detection of a disease early. This method significantly reduces the time between donor exposure to the virus and the appearance of antibodies. This way, it allows for earlier detection of the infection and thereby reduces the possibility of transmission via transfusion.
  ,
  ,
  Pvt hospitals to blame
  ,
  ,
  According to NACO data, of the 66 NACO-assisted blood banks in Karnataka, 40 are in the government sector and 26 are in NGOs, charitable and voluntary sector, without a single one in the private hospital sector. IFBS officials say Karnataka has already taken steps to curb transmission of infection through blood transfusion and that it's the only state government in the country to have made ID NAT mandatory in all government blood banks and hospitals. However, this crucial blood safety technique hasn't been widely adopted by private hospitals in the state.

"Nov 21, 2016, 13:36 IST",'Vaccine against HIV infection closer to reality',"

  MELBOURNE: In a significant progress towards the development of a , against ,, scientists have developed a new approach to help the immune system actively fight the virus in the body.
  
  ,
  For the first time, researchers showed that a combined approach - using a common , to introduce a vaccine into the body, as well as an injection of a DNA-based vaccine - may help protect against HIV in the gut and bodily cavities.
  ,
  ,
  ""With sexual activity being one of the primary methods of HIV transmission, it is necessary to try to protect those parts of the body that are most likely to encounter the virus first,"" said Branka Grubor-Bauk, from the University of Adelaide in Australia.
  ,
  ,
  ""A possible reason why previous HIV vaccine trials have not been successful is because of this lack of a frontline protection,"" Grubor-Bauk said.
  ,
  ,
  The laboratory studies, conducted so far in mice represent an important step forward in attempts to introduce a first line of defence against HIV at the site of infection.
  ,
  ,
  ""In mice, we delivered a rhinovirus (or common cold virus) inside the nose, and this virus had been altered to include HIV proteins,"" Grubor-Bauk said.
  ,
  ,
  ""At the same time, the mice also received an injection into the skin containing a DNA-based vaccine. This approach resulted in very specific responses in the immune system,"" she said.
  ,
  ,
  ""This vaccine approach encompasses two different arms of the immune system: white blood cells that attack the HIV virus, and specific antibodies that recognise and shut down HIV-positive cells,"" she added.
  ,
  ,
  ""There is an element of HIV known as Tat that helps the virus to replicate quite rapidly,"" said Eric Gowans, professor at University of Adelaide.
  ,
  ,
  The antibodies inhibit the Tat effect, preventing HIV from replicating itself, Gowans added.
  ,
  ,
  ""Overall, we found that infection was considerably reduced in the mice we studied,"" he said.

"Sreemoyee Chatterjee,Updated: Nov 30, 2016, 06:11 IST","Only 21% of HIV positive transgenders, 33% of sex workers have access to treatment","

  BENGALURU: Almost two-thirds of the transgenders in India have no access to treatment of sexually transmitted infections, says a recent study by medical journal Lancet. The situation is no better in Karnataka, with only 21% of the , and 33% of the infected female sex workers undergoing anti-retroviral therapy, according to the , (KSAPS).
  
  ,
  Ahead of World AIDS Day on December 1 (Thursday), TOI found that of the 6,756 HIV-infected female sex workers in the state, only 2,257 are benefitting from anti-retroviral therapy. Similarly, of the 175 transgenders with HIV, only 37 are being treated. This despite the HIV Bill introduced in 2014 — it was amended this year — which makes anti-retroviral therapy (it can enhance longevity) a legal right for all HIV patients.
  ,
  ,
  ""A recent study conducted by Swasti for the , revealed that often doctors refuse to treat individuals from the transgender community. They are either ignored or are shown the door by doctors, who say they don't know how to treat them,"" said ,, director, Avahan - Swasti, a health resource centre that works with the transgender community, sex workers and gay men. The study covered transgenders in five states — Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, UP, Gujarat and Maharashtra.
  ,
  ,
  The study showed that even transgenders are hesitant about getting themselves tested for HIV, though hospitals provide the facility. ""There is an assumption that only those who are sexually active or sexually promiscuous need to get the test done. Transgenders are judged not only by hospital staff but also their peers,"" she added.
  ,
  ,
  Highlighting the distress of female sex workers, thoracic surgeon and director of , and Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Chest Diseases, Dr Shashidhar Buggi, said: ""We cannot expect others to stop discriminating against sex workers if the doctor community itself is biased. The harsh reality is despite being aware of the nature of HIV virus, the medical fraternity often chooses not to treat an infected patient. The stigma is even more deep-rooted when the patient happens to be a sex worker.""
  ,
  ,
  Stating that numbers don't depict the real picture, Dr Buggi explained: ""The existence of prevention societies is not enough to bring about a positive change in the health condition of sex workers, as the ground reality is different from what's there on paper. There is no proper retrieving system in place, with no one to assess the work of these organizations and question their accountability. Most of the cases these organizations record are under-reported.""
  ,
  ,
  Demonetization a hindrance
  ,
  ,
  The recent demonetization policy has only added to the plight of transgenders as far as treatment is concerned. ""It has become very difficult to meet medical and travel expenses. I recently had to undergo a uterus operation, which was an expensive procedure. The tests and follow-up visits have drilled a hole in my pocket and scrapping of the Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes has only made it worse,"" said Usha, an HIV positive transgender.
  ,
  ,
  Manta, another transgender who's a sex worker, said: ""I am HIV positive but I have learnt to take care of my health. However, after demonetization, my income has drastically reduced. Either the clients don't pay or they hand over high denomination notes. Either way, I am left with no money.""
  ,
  ,
  Social hierarchy a barrier
  ,
  ,
  Another study on transgenders revealed that social hierarchical systems play a major role in deciding which healthcare services an individual can access. Every decision vests with the guru. The study found that 12.3% of the community members opted for informal surgeries conducted by someone from the community or the guru as opposed to formal services provided in hospitals.

  ""We found that among those newly infected with the virus, 91% have been infected due to unsafe sex,'' said Dr Srikala Acharya of MDACS. HIV spreads through sexual contact, unsafe blood transfusion or by sharing needles. While unprotected sexual contact has for long been the main cause of the HIV AIDS epidemic, what is surprising this time around is that the all-India average is lower. ""Compared to Mumbai's 91%, the all-India figure is 80%,"" added Dr Acharya. The , control figures for 2015-16 show that among the remaining cases, 5.7% got infected from infected mother to child, 0.2% people were infected due to unsafe blood and 0.5% through infected needles or syringes.

  THANE: Hailing it as a defining moment against the deadly HIV virus, the Thane District AIDS Prevention and Control Unit (DAPCU) said the prevalence of the disease has slipped sharply in recent years in Thane and Palghar districts.
  
  ,
  From a high of 5,154 HIV affected cases detected in 2010-11, the number fell to 3,129 in 201-16 and has further halved to 1,440 up to October 2017. In case of expecting mothers the numbers slid from a high of 261 in 2010-11 to 153 women who tested positive for HIV virus in 2015-16 and the latest figures up to October 2016 indicate only 85 women were HIV positive .

  The fall in the HIV positive cases in Thane and Palghar districts is a crucial indicator that the awareness campaign and sensitization programmes organized by the state and voluntary groups in the last 30 years have shown positive results.

  ""The figures are extremely relevant as there is high mobility due to the national and state highways passing through them. The truck drivers and cleaners were notorious to buy cheap sex along the roadside and were potential carriers, passing it on to their wives back home and possibly to their children. However, the awareness drive helped as the HIV positive cases dropped drastically even as the number of people who opted for HIV tests in the recent years rose,'' said ,, district programme officer of DAPCU.

The sole NGO, which is currently working with the MSM (men who have sex with men) population, is involved in a number of programmes, but others say not enough is being done to cover a large migrant population in the city that is potential risk for people in other states.

  According to Srikant of , (SOSVA), the only active NGO currently working among the MSM population, there is a large migrant population and female sex workers who are currently not made aware of HIV/AIDS at the ground level. ""The migrant population changes every six to seven months, so there is a constant requirement to raise awareness among them. The risk of HIV is not only limited to them, but also extends to their wives and families when they go back home,"" Srikant says.

  Gurgaon has already recorded 158 cases of HIV till the end of October 2016. The number of cases in 2015 was 184, while the figure stood at 144 and 145 in the 2014 and 2013, respectively, according to the data provided by ,'s nodal officer (Gurgaon).

  LUCKNOW: People detected with , in their , can now ask for immediate initiation of the anti-retroviral therapy (ART) now that the health ministry and , have done away with the mandatory criteria of CD4.
  
  ,
  ""The new system, followed after recommendation from the ,, is in place across all ART centers in India,"" said Prof AK Tripathi, head of haematology department, King George's Medical University that runs UP's biggest ART center, talking to TOI on World , Day here on Thursday.
  ,
  ,
  CD4 count is the estimation of white blood cells in a person's body. It shows how fit a person's natural defence system is to fight pathogens, infections and illnesses. While the CD4 count of a healthy person is anything between 500 and 1,500, the count of an HIV-infected person tends to drop below the normal.
  ,
  ,
  Since the launch of the National HIV AIDS Control programme in India, it has been the basis for starting ART treatment. Earlier, a person with CD4 of 250 or less was put on ART medicines. This was later revised to 350 to benefit more patients.
  ,
  ,
  Those with CD4 count above the range were considered 'healthy' and had to wait for their condition to deteriorate for the treatment to start. However, HIV-positive pregnant women, children, people with TB or history of TB or hepatitis B, C and discordant couples were excluded.
  ,
  ,
  In 2013, WHO called for a revision of the benchmark and pressed for starting ART even if CD4 count was around the normal range of 500. ""It based the move on a number of sub-Saharan, South American and American studies which showed better survival and quality of life if ART was started at CD4 count of 500,"" he explained.

  WHO document on the issue cites a number of advantages of early medication, one of them being that CD4 count remains in the normal range.

  ""The ART centre provides free medication for 30 days. So, when a patient fails to come to the centre to collect medicines for the next period, they are termed as missing. Ideally, HIV positive patients are not supposed to miss a single dose of medication as it affects their immune system.

  Only 40% are reportedly from the city, while the rest are from far-off places like Panvel and Thane. ""A majority are daily-wage earners and find it difficult to travel. Change of job or shifting to a different place are some other reasons,"" the official added.

WHO recommends they receive information and links to counselling as well as rapid referral to prevention, treatment and care services.

""Millions of people with HIV are still missing out on life-saving treatment, which can also prevent HIV transmission to others,"" said Dr Margaret Chan, director-general, WHO.

  The prohibitive cost of the test device and the lack of manpower to operate it are the factors leading to the delay in NAAT implementation in the state.

  NAAT, which was approved for use in 2002 by the FDA, can detect HIV infections in blood donors earlier than other screening tests because it detects viral genes rather than antibodies or antigens.
  ,
  ,
  The appearance of antibodies, which happens after an infected donor's immune system responds to the virus, requires time. Similarly, detection of antigens also requires time as it needs a higher level of virus to appear in the bloodstream. In both cases, a 'window period' is created during which a donor can be infected but test negative for HIV.

  AIDS deaths rose from 945 in 2013-14 to 1,270 in 2015-16 (see box). Activists are alarmed that the year-on-year increase in fatalities has ranged from 12% to 20%. Most blame it on the country's restrictive antiretroviral therapy (ART) strategy . An analysis shows the fataies are declining in those lities are declining in those who are taking the ART treatment on a regular basis. The increase in deaths is mainly in the group that has been diagnosed with HIV but is considered too healthy to be started on ART. In India, a patient is given free ART drugs only when his her CD4 count drops to 500, or the patient has a TB or hepatitis co-infection. The CD4 count is an indicator of how well the body's immune system is working.
  ,
  ,
  Globally , patient groups have been demanding that each and every HIV-positive person should be given free ART drugs by their governments.The WHO in 2015 had recommended that all HIV patients should be started on ART irrespective of their CD4 count. In India, out of 21 lakh people living with the disease, only 55% are currently on free ART.In Mumbai too, out of the 70,000-odd people living with the disease, a little over 35,000 are on the drug regimen.

""People who suffer from HIV are extremely vulnerable to opportunistic infections.But our systems are not geared to treat those infections,"" he said. Another NGO member said the programme is going through a lack of motivation and urgency to control the disease.

His is a two-pronged struggle. On the one hand, while he fights the infection in his body, on the other he has to battle social ostracism.

  The HIV status, whether that of a child or an adult, is not revealed, but sometimes it does come out exposing them to discrimination, Borges said.

"Nov 30, 2016, 05:16 IST","New HIV infections down, but AIDS deaths rise 35% in 3 years","

  Deaths due to full blown AIDS in the city have jumped by nearly 35% over the last three years though the number of fresh HIV infections has shown a decline, shows figures collated by the Mumbai District Aids Control Society.
  
  ,
  They suggest that a majority of the HIV cases are detected in the 35-49 age group, indicating that awareness campaigns are probably not making early inroads.
  ,
  ,
  AIDS deaths rose from 945 in 2013-14 to 1,270 in 2015-16 (see box). Activists are alarmed that the year-on-year increase in fatalities has ranged from 12% to 20%. Most blame it on the country's restrictive antiretroviral therapy (ART) strategy. An analysis shows the fataies are declining in those lities are declining in those who are taking the ART treatment on a regular basis. The increase in deaths is mainly in the group that has been diagnosed with HIV but is considered too healthy to be started on ART. In India, a patient is given free ART drugs only when his her CD4 count drops to 500, or the patient has a TB or hepatitis co-infection. The CD4 count is an indicator of how well the body's immune system is working.
  ,
  ,
  Globally, patient groups have been demanding that each and every HIV-positive person should be given free ART drugs by their governments.The WHO in 2015 had recommended that all HIV patients should be started on ART irrespective of their CD4 count. In India, out of 21 lakh people living with the disease, only 55% are currently on free ART.In Mumbai too, out of the 70,000-odd people living with the disease, a little over 35,000 are on the drug regimen.
  ,
  ,
  ,, one of the founding members of ,, said the health ministry was looking away from a mammoth human crisis. ""People who suffer from HIV are extremely vulnerable to opportunistic infections.But our systems are not geared to treat those infections,"" he said. Another NGO member said the programme is going through a lack of motivation and urgency to control the disease.
  ,
  ,
  A , (Naco) member said the higher number of deaths could be a result of better tracking mechanisms. Dr ,, BMC's executive health officer, said: ""AIDS deaths often happen due to opportunistic infections and multi-organ failure. They don't happen overnight and the disease manifests over many years. Factors such as nutrition play a pivotal role too.""
  ,
  ,
  She added that MDACS is aggressively working towards bringing new infections to zero. ""We have to catch and treat them early.""
  ,
  ,
  Statistics at the moment do not suggest that is happening: a majority are getting diagnosed between 35 and 49 years. In 2015-16, 44.3% of the fresh infections were in that age bracket, followed by 26.1% cases in 25-34. Overall though, fresh HIV infections have dropped by 55% in the last five years.
  ,
  ,
  A Naco official said the Centre is toying with the idea of starting ART for all. ""It would entail an additional cost of Rs 100 crore as more than 1.5 lakh people would be added to the regimen. Money is not a problem, but the logistics of procuring the drugs is being looked into,"" he said.

"Updated: Nov 30, 2016, 08:47 IST",HIV+ youth more prone to depression,"

  ,
  While those afflicted with HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) are highly prone to slipping into depression; youth and teenagers are particularly more susceptible to depression if they have no family support.
  
  ,
  The Anti-Retroviral Therapy (ART), given free at ART centres of the Goa State AIDS Control Society (GSACS), is a big succour for persons living HIV, but counsellors and doctors say that counselling them is tough. The level of depression among adolescents and youth is so acute that some have lost their spirit of optimism.
  ,
  ,
  An official said HIV-positive youth and teenagers are more likely to lead a depressed life if they have no family support. Sadly, in the case of most of the youth, family ties are missing with one or both parents long dead. The majority are brought up in orphanages. A few are looked after by their extended families.
  ,
  ,
   ,, 23, who was raised in an orphanage since birth — his parents had left him in the hospital after his HIV status came to light — has grown so pessimistic that he refuses to believe that anything positive will happen in his life. The ART staff try to boost his morale by telling him about the research under way to invent new drugs to improve quality of life of persons living with HIV, but Akash's hopes are long lost.
  ,
  ,
  ""Akash doesn't even want to consider a possibility that better drugs that can cure HIV will be invented. He is certain that HIV will not leave him till his death,"" a counsellor said.
  ,
  ,
  Of the 7,000-odd persons registered with the ART Centre of the , (GMC) and hospital, Bambolim, maximum numbers are of those in the reproductive age group, a source said and added that most of them are depressed.
  ,
  ,
   ,, 19, a class XII student, has failed to keep pace with studies. He went into depression after he started developing severe side effects of ART. ""Due to the illness he has not been able to concentrate. His mother's second marriage has further upset him. We have advised him to complete his education through correspondence courses,"" the official said pointing out that having to lead life without family support increases the probability of depression.
  ,
  ,
  ""Once they turn 18, they have nowhere to go. ART lengthens lives and improves quality of life. But, now, the bigger question before them is how to lead a normal life, and that, too, all alone,"" he said and added that there has to be some backup plan to enable HIV-positive persons in the reproductive age group to lead a healthy life.
  ,
  ,
  For the last few months, Shivanand Azrekar, 25, has been going through bouts of depression. , is married and has one child and every time he visits the ART centre, the first question he asks the staff is, ""how much time do I have?"" Despite being put on ART, Azrekar's condition is deteriorating, the official said.
  ,
  ,
  On a positive note, Goa has succeeded in bringing mother-to-child transmission to zero. Also, the ART centre has some help coming its way in treating depressed HIV-positive youth and teenagers. Yuva clinic, a counselling centre, was opened at GMC in October to offer counselling to patients in the age group of 10-19.

  MUMBAI: About 43,000 sensitive pathology reports, including those of , patients, were exposed , by a Thane-based laboratory. The leak, which underscores the vulnerability of electronic medical records, was pointed out by an Australian web security expert who stumbled upon the reports in an open online folder that could be easily seen and downloaded.

  He also said the damage could be widespread as the folder had been indexed by Google. ""So simply shutting down the site won't remove the full exposure, Google will need to be scrubbed too,"" he wrote. This means that the files could be lurking in the cache folders of search engines. The data was probably lying unsecured for about six months now.

  HS Pathology Private Ltd issued a statement on Friday saying that their website was ""hacked"". The lab said that they were in the process of filing a complaint with the cyber cell of Mumbai police.

""The multiple attempts to breach our site had forced us to migrate to a stronger system. Since our staff was being trained to use the new system, we thought we will complete our processes by January,"" said the executive.

"Dec 6, 2016, 08:21 IST",IMA bats for nucleic acid test over Elisa to detect HIV,"

  KOCHI: ,'s Kochi branch has asked city hospitals to choose , (NAT) over the traditional , test to detect , , hepatitis B and C, especially before blood transfusion.
  
  ,
  This was after IMA, analysed blood samples of 49,000 persons and found that Elisa test failed to detect several infections, thus increasing the risk of transmitting bloodborne diseases from donor to recipient. IMA conducted Elisa test as well as NAT on all 49,000 persons who donated blood to IMA 's blood bank over the past three years. The results showed that eight cases of hepatitis B, one HIV and one case of hepatitis C were not detected by Elisa test. However, it was detected using NAT.
  ,
  ,
  ""Blood transfusion is a lifesaving procedure. But, there is always minimal risk of transmitting blood-borne infections like HIV , hepatitis B and C from the donor to the recipient. The conventional Elisa test employed in blood banks fail to detect infections in the window period,"" said IMA president Dr M Narayanan. At present, only IMA 's blood bank has NAT facility in the city .
  ,
  ,
  While donors in the city welcomed the move, they were concerned about two things: cost and whether it is a ploy by private companies to sell their NAT kit. ""Studies have shown that NAT is better than Elisa.Government hospitals have to introduce NAT to popularise it,"" said Jishnu Raj, coordinator, Blood Donors, Kerala.While Elisa test costs around Rs 400, NAT costs Rs 800.
  ,
  ,
  Both Elisa and NAT are used to determine if a person has antibodies related to certain infectious conditions. However, there is the issue of window period. Window period is the length of time after infection during which a test has a higher chance of incorrectly reporting the absence of disease (false negative). The window period for antibody tests can range from 3 weeks to 6 months.
  ,
  ,
  ""Nucleic acid tests typically have shorter window periods, and this means that they can be used more reliably , particularly in cases where the exact point of infection isn't entirely clear,"" said Dr Narayanan.
  ,
  ,
  NAT was first introduced between 1999 and 2001 in blood banks across France, Germany , Italy, Spain, Switzerland and the ,. Studies showed that countries that introduced NAT have en countered a decrease in residual risk of viral transmissions. Although, other safety measures such as more stringent selection of blood donors have contributed as well; a marked decrease is evident.
  ,
  ,
  The residual risk for Hepatitis C virus (HCV) transmission prior to NAT was 0.64 cases per million in France and 3.94 per million in Spain which decreased to 0.1 per million and 2.33 per million respectively after NAT was adopted.HIV NAT yield rates were estimated at 0.3 per million donations in France and Spain as opposed to 0.59 and 2.48 respectively preceding NAT.
  ,
  ,
  IMA's move is crucial as India has the second-highest pool of HIV persons estimated at 5.7 million and 3-5% HBV and 1-2% HCV cases reported among a population of almost 1.2 billion. Post-transfusion prevalence of hepatitis has been observed at 1-1.8% for hepatitis B and 0.28-0.5% for hepatitis C and 0.23-0.47 for HIV.

  ""To ensure that blood banks and hospitals shift to NAT, we will soon be conducting a training session for doctors,"" added Dr Narayanan.

  GURUGRAM: The trend of women not getting tested for HIV, even after being counselled, is rising. This, despite doctors working hard to eliminate , transmission from mother to child. Approximately, a third of these women are pregnant.
  
  ,
  According to the latest statistics, over 3,000 women in Gurugram did not undergo HIV tests till October 2016. Of this, 1,215 pregnant women had been counselled to do so. Till October, 14 cases of pregnant women having HIV have been confirmed.

  According to doctors, it is possible to eliminate transmission, but only if mothers agree to get tested.
  ,
  ,
  Dr Himanshu Batra, head of the department of paediatrics at Columbia Asia hospital said, HIV testing is a part of routine screening at all private hospitals. ""All of my patients get tested for HIV, no matter what,"" he said. It is not the case everywhere, though.
  ,
  ,
  In 2015, 7,700 men were counselled at government-run integrated counselling and testing centres (ICTC), and 6,660 men opted to get tested for HIV. The number is higher in the case of women, where 21,562 women underwent counselling last year, but only 18,449 opted for testing. The gap is 3,113 women. In 2014, this number was 1,600, in 2013, it was 1,005 and in 2012 it was 899.
  ,
  ,
  According to Vijay Kumar, the nodal district officer of the , programme run by the ,, there are many reasons behind the figures.
  ,
  ,
  ""Some of them don't get tested because they don't want to wait for the long hours of testing (it takes around two hours for an HIV test). Others think they are not at much risk, and therefore drop out of the tests. We cannot force them as it is done only with their consent,"" he said.
  ,
  ,
  HIV infection can be caused through various means: sexual transmission, blood transfusion, intravenous drug use and from mother to child. However, 90% of children with HIV contract it from their parents.

  According to doctors, a complete cure is possible if detection is early.

"Mihika Basu,Updated: Dec 26, 2016, 10:07 IST",Scientists proffer new method to weaken HIV,"

  Though the , (AIDS) can be controlled with a cocktail of ,, the disease, caused by the Human Immunodeficiency Virus, or HIV, does not have a permanent cure as yet. The treatment of AIDS, however, has got a major boost with , from Bengaluru reporting in a study that if the mutation rate of HIV virus is increased by two to six times, it could become ineffective against its host/human body in 10 years. Lead researcher Narendra Dixit, however, cautions that by increasing the mutation rate, such a person will not get cured, but their findings reveal how long it will take for the virus to become non-infectious, and the disease non-progressive.
  
  ,
  Some of these drugs to increase the mutation levels are already undergoing clinical trials. According to the researchers, a major advantage of these drugs is that they are not susceptible to drug resistance. Hence, Dixit, who is an associate professor at Department of Chemical Engineering, Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bengaluru, said that in the coming years, with better drug combinations, the treatment window could be reduced further. Their findings have been reported in ""Physical Biology"" journal.
  ,
  ,
  Scientists have so far failed in their efforts to find a permanent cure as HIV virus mutates or changes rapidly, thus making drugs and potential vaccines ineffective. This implies that by the time a drug tries to make the virus ineffective, another mutant that is resistant to the drug, has already developed. Hence, this latest finding is important because it establishes that a threshold level exists for HIV and the virus loses its potency level if its mutation rate is increased by over six times its current or natural mutation rate.
  ,
  ,
  ""One reason why researchers have not been successful in their endeavour to find a permanent cure for , is because of the high rate at which the virus mutates, causing it to overcome the selection pressures imposed by drugs and potential vaccines. From the virus's point of view, however, there is a flipside to having very high mutation rates. If it increases beyond a tipping point, called error threshold, then it leads to low fitness in the virus population, making it an ineffective pathogen,"" said Dixit.
  ,
  ,
  Prof Dixit and his team have been studying the process of infection caused by HIV and its evolution using certain computer simulation models in the laboratory, which allow them to closely track the fitness levels of the genetically diverse populations within a host and the factors that contribute to it.
  ,
  ,
  The finding also has implications for how we treat AIDS, said the research team. High mutation rates can be induced in HIV using a special class of anti-retroviral drugs. If the mutation rate can be raised to the error threshold, then, in principle, the virus can be prevented from causing progressive infection. This research shows that, in fact, such a benign state can be achieved by using mutation-inducing drugs for a period of about 10 years. For their study, the research team used information from the drugs which are currently under trial. They demonstrated in their simulation model that by administering these drugs for 10 years, the replicating HIV will become harmless. This, according to experts, can be an alternative method or strategy to attacking and eventually killing the virus.

  HYDERABAD: A weed commonly found on roadsides in Hyderabad and elsewhere in the country may have the potential to fight the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).
  
  ,
  Experiments conducted by researchers at the Department of Zoology, Infectious Diseases and Metabolic Diseases Research Laboratory, Kakatiya University in Warangal, show that the molecule obtained from the weed Aerva lanata had up to 91% efficacy in fighting HIV. Synthetic drugs presently used for HIV treatment have side effects. Researchers hope that since the molecule taken from Aerva lanata is natural, it may not have any negative impact.
  ,
  ,
  ""We have suggested that medical universities and major research institutions conduct clinical research on our laboratory finding to corroborate the results in patients as we cannot do tests on human beings,"" said Dr ,, one of the researchers.

  The roots of the weed have been in use by tribals in the forests of Khammam fro ages.Tribals have been using the plant for a number of bacterial and viral diseases. ""We collected the weed from jungles as part of the ethnomedical research and found it effective in fighting HIV.

  ""The extracts of Aerva la nata showed inhibitory activity on HIV. The results are remarkable and can be used to develop a new drug for HIV treatment or other infectious diseases caused by the pathogenic micro-organisms, for which plant sterols may play a distinctive role,"" Dr Estari said. He said further work is in progress to evaluate the active compound obtained from the weed. ""It has the potential to inhibit the enzyme called HIV reverse transcriptase (RT).

  Quoting official data, HHF president Mujtaba Hasan Askari said Telangana recorded 11,846 new cases of HIVAIDS during 2016. With this, the total PLHIV population in the state has increased to 1,73,398 (Pre ART2016).""This is an increase of seven per cent in the HIV AIDS cases during 2016 over the previous year (2015). But, if the data prior to 2015 is taken into account, one cannot deduce whether the burden of the disease has increased or decreased as it pertained to undivided state. At an average, 950 to 1,000 new cases of HIVAIDS were reported every month during 2016,"" he said.
  ,
  ,
  Askari said the total HIVAIDS burden in Telangana seemed to be underestimated. ""We found discrepancy between the numbers shared by , (TSACS) and the data obtained from ART centres. TSACS officials claimed that the difference could be on account of transfers to ART Link centres or ART Plus centres,"" he said.
  ,
  ,
  The Foundation also conducted a detailed field level survey across the state and submitted the findings to the project director of TSACS. He said the TSACS did not share data on HIV-TB co-infection in the state. Incidentally, the mortality due to TB in HIV cases is very high.

  Ramesh is not isolated in trauma. A survey conducted in Telangana revealed that 93% people living with , face stigma at workplaces, in their neighbourhoods and even at hospitals. This has forced several of them to travel long distances to reach , (ART) centres.

  The survey, carried out by city-based Helping ,, began in mid-February and covered 26 ART centres. The team interviewed 561 patients across the state, 182 of whom were from Hyderabad, to find that 93% of them faced discrimination at their places of work and while accessing healthcare or getting rented accommodation in case they disclose their HIV-positive status.ART counsellors and medical experts were also interviewed.

  ,
  The survey also exposed exploitation by private hospitals.As many as 60% of the respondents said that private hospitals make them pay through the nose for treatment. In case they choose to go to a government hospital, they are met with hesitance. This is why most HIV patients prefer to keep their identities guarded. As many as 55% of the respondents withheld their names for fear of discrimination and only shared their ART registration number in the survey.

  What's worse is that 25% reported facing discrimination at ART centres too. They said they faced problems in collecting medicines and had to put up with rude behaviour of staff. The stigma is so high that 54% said they went to ART centres far away from their homes for fear of being exposed in their own neighbourhoods.Most patients also discard medicine boxes just outside ART centres to ensure they are not identified.

"Apr 29, 2017, 06:00 IST",THE NATARAJA WHO MADE PERINI SHIVATANDAVAM HIS LIFE’S PURPOSE,"

  A dance guru, scholar and musicologist par excellence, late , needs no introduction. How he revived ,, the 700-year-old dance form of Telangana, is stuff of legend. Hailing from a well-to-do family, he thrust aside affluence to pursue his passion — dance. How the legend faced his father's wrath, discarded his family name, embraced poverty and became one of the most revered dance scholars in the country, makes for a fascinating story.
  
  ,
  He chose dance over family
  ,
  ,
  Born in Bali to Ramamohan Rao and Damayanthi Devi on March 21, 1923, Ramakrishna was the middle child among three siblings. His love for dance began early in life after witnessing a temple dancer
  ,
  perform in his native village as an eight year old. Though his mother was a proficient singer, veena exponent and a poet, his father didn't approve of his fondness for dance. But young Ramakrishna was adamant. To protect him from his father's ire, his elder brother Shyamsundar took him away to Sri Kalahasti at the age of 14 and put him under the tutelage of Nayudupeta Rajamma, an old , dancer. He mastered the art that was dying because Devadasi tradition was outlawed.
  ,
  When his father found that Ramakrishna had not mended his ways, he was sent back to the Ramakrishna Mutt in Madras to wean him away from dancing. But there again his
  ,
  devotion to dance led Ramakrishna in search of another teacher. He went to Pandanallur to train under Meenakshi Sundaram Pillai, but she had nothing much to offer than the ones he has already mastered. When his father learnt that sending him off to Ramakrishna Mutt did not put dance off his mind, he sent Ramakrishna, now matriculate, to Nagpur for higher education, but there again the determined dancer didn't stop searching for new avenues to master the art.
  ,
  ,
  How Ramakrishna became , 
  ,
  ,
  But thankfully, Ramakrishna's virtuosity in dance found a patron in ,, the prince of ,. He was summoned to dance before the prince in a court full of artisans. That performance earned him the epithet, 'Nataraj' that went on to become his family name. There is an interesting anecdote about how Nataraja became his adopted family name. ""Before he got patronage of the Bhandara zamindar, Ramakrishna's life was a struggle. He had no place to go, no one to look after. His father who came to see him gave him ample money and asked him to come back home and live in plenty — but he has to leave his dance completely. He left his money on the table. Ramakrishna went to his father the next day and returned the money. His father was so angry that he said that if he were a man, he would never use the family name and never refer to his parents publicly. Ramakrishna obliged his father and never used his family name,"" wrote dance critic Prof Sharma in a tribute piece.
  ,
  ,
  The three years he spent in the court of Raja Ganapati Rao Pandya were rewarding. He was revered, honoured and appreciated. But everything looked like a mirage to him. He wanted to go back to his native state and nourish the classical traditions of Andhra that were in dormant state.
  ,
  ,
  He played a stellar role in helping Kuchipudi gain classical status
  ,
  ,
  Ramakrishna is a name synonymous with Perini Shivatandavam, but his contribution to Kuchipudi and Andhra Natyaam cannot be overlooked. After he traced his steps back to his native state, he started working on revial and exposure of Andhra art traditions. ""When Kuchipudi was denied classical status, Ramakrishna, the then spokesman of State Sangeet Natak Akademi decided to organise the historic All India Dance Seminar on Kuchipudi and other classical dance traditions of Andhra. Experts from all over India attended the seminar. The effort was also to promote Kuchipudi as the cultural identity of the newly formed state of Andhra,"" says Anuradha Jonnalagadda, a Kuchipudi exponent and a disciple of Ramakrishna. Ramakrishna, the convenor of the festival demonstrated the richness of the dance form. This seminar gave Kuchipudi the much deserved national recognition.
  ,
  ,
  Reviving the devadasi tradition
  ,
  ,
  During his stay with Nayudupeta Rajamma, he realised that the abhinaya school is on the verge of extinction. After an extensive research in ancient dance traditions, he started writing on the dance traditions of Andhra. In an effort to revive Andhra's lasya tradition, he along with Annabathula Buli Venkataratnamma went door-to- door in search of a Devadasi performer who remembered the tradition. He found 16 performers, brought them on one platform and organised a lecture series, Abhinaya Sadassu, in 1970 at Rajahmundry. He didn't stop at that. He reconstructed oral texts belonging to Agama, Kucheri and Bhagavata traditions and made few of his talented disciples undergo rigorous training of the art. To do away with the stigma of Devadasi system, it was decided that the dance form will be renamed as Andhra Natyam. Ramakrishna was instrumental in its accreditation at the university level.
  ,
  ,
  Stumbling into 'Prerana' and giving birth to Perini
  ,
  ,
  ""While going through Jayapa Senani's Nritta Ratnavali, he noticed the mention of a 'prerana' dance, performed only by men to invoke Lord Shiva. He did his research on agama texts, re-conceptualised the textual evidence of the dance form from Jayapa Senani's Bharataarnavam and Nritta Ratnavali, Sarangadeva's Sangeeta Ratnakara and Sarvanga Bhoopala Yechendra's ,, studied the temple sculptures of Telangana, along with the his vast knowledge of various dance forms, he revived Prerana as Perini,"" says Kala Krishna, another disciple of the Perini revivalist.
  ,
  Ramakrishna emphasised that the dance be performed on music that is in sync with the wartime mood. ""He developed a specific style of playing mridangam thatshaped the movement of the dance. Unfortunately we don't have the mridangam players now. After Dhupam Suryalingam who had equal contribution in revival of Perini, it was his disciple, Balarama Moorthy who used to play the instrument. Now without a mridangam player we perform only on recorded music,"" laments Kala Krishna.
  ,
  ,
  Nataraja Ramakrishna—a name not recognised
  ,
  Despite his contributions, Ramakrishna did not get the recognition he deserves. Voicing his discontentment Kala Krishna says, ""The Telangana government is trying to make Perini the dance form of Telangana. It was incorporated in curriculum as a part of Andhra Natyam, but since the last two months it is being studied as a separate subject. But the government has not bestowed upon him the honours and recognition he deserved. Isn't it unfair to recognise a work but not the name behind it!""

  For 45-year-old Siriyapushpam, a daily wage labourer who earns `100 a day, falling ill costs her dear. The Kodambakkam resident is HIV positive and has to forgo a day's wage to travel to a , in Tambaram. At times when the prescribed medicine is unavailable at the hospital, she has to buy the same from outside at a steeper price. While a weak immune system and lack of a nutritious diet make Siriyapushpam susceptible to frequent bouts of illnesses, she says meeting the increasing medical expense gets harder for her each time.
  
  ,
  Siriyapushpam's case is not isolated. A complete absence of insurance cover against opportunistic infections (infections caused due to a weak immune system), affects more than 21 lakh people living with HIV (PLHIV) across the country, including 1.42 lakh in TN.
  ,
  ,
  It has been more than a month since the HIV and AIDS (Prevention and Control) Act 2014 came into place, but insurers say, they are yet to get guidelines on including such patients in health, life and critical illness segments. The Act protects PLHIV against denial, termination, discontinuation and unfair treatment with regard to employment, educational establishments, healthcare services, residing or renting property, standing for public or private office, and provision of insurance. But without specific instructions, PLHIV in the country remain without cover.
  ,
  ,
  According to 'India HIV Estimation 2015' report of National AIDS Control Organisation, there were 21.17 lakh PLHIV, including 86,000 newly infected people in 2015. With the highest prevalence being recorded in Nagaland (1.29%), TN's prevalence rate (0.27%) was higher than the national average of 0.26%.
  ,
  ,
  ,
  ,
  ,
  ""I have seen cases where hospitals have refused to conduct surgeries to remove uterine fibroids on HIV positive persons. Others charge two to three times the actual cost to operate. If an insurance scheme is introduced for PLHIV, there would be some regulation,"" Kousalya Periasamy, founder of NGO Positive Women's Network.
  ,
  ,
  According to a 2006 UNDP study on the socio-economic impact of HIV and AIDS in India, a person with HIV bears expenses between `25,000 - `30,000 a year. The situation is worse if the earning member in a family is frequently hospitalised.
  ,
  ,
  HIV/AIDS and related complications are excluded from critical insurance covers and insurers say they haven't received instructions to include it in their policies. Health insurance for groups, however, exists. ""In the group health segment, Cigna TTK offers AIDS/HIV cover up to full sum insured under the global health group policy. It covers Indian locals and expatriates working abroad under one umbrella. This cover is available for employees, dependent spouse and children,"" says Sandeep Patel, CEO and MD, Cigna TTK Health Insurance.
  ,
  ,
  Star Health & Allied Insurance provides group cover under the NetPlus policy where the proposal has to come from NGOs or government agencies. However, expenses for HIV treatment are excluded as are people with low CD4 count.
  ,
  ,
  ""Only if companies take the initiative and insure PLHIV for frequent hospitalisations and opportunistic infections can insurance create an impact and gain public trust,"" says Dr S Prakash, senior executive director, Star Health and Allied Insurance.
  ,
  ,
  Others say the new law is a step in the right direction. ""With more such steps and availability of more data to enable pricing of products, we can look towards greater inclusion,"" says Ashish Mehrotra, MD and CEO, Max Bupa Health Insurance.
  ,
  ,
  But for rural households, 72% of who, according to a 2014 NSSO study, rely on private hospitals for treatment, retail insurance continues to be a dream. Dr Sathish Kumar, country doctor for Solidarity and Action Against HIV Infection in India said cover for PLHIV from lower income groups particularly need attention. Presently, the collective gets such PLHIV enrolled in the Rashtriya , Yojana (RSBY). Under the scheme, PLHIV from BPL families can get free hospitalisation up to ₹30,000 per family per year.
  ,
  ,
  While increasing medical expenses burn a hole in their pockets, patients say unavailability of medicines at ART (Antiretroviral Therapy) centres forces them to make additional trips to the health centre, which robs them of their day's income.
  ,
  ,
  Nutrition is another aspect which seems to have been brushed aside. ,, a former programme officer of the state AIDS control programme and consultant (community medicine & infectious disease) at SIMS Hospital says, ""Medicines will work only if PLHIV take nutritious meals,"" adding that the Centre should implement a scheme similar to the mid-day meal for PLHIV.
  ,
  ,
  In December 2013, the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA) announced that people with HIV or other pre-existing illnesses would need to pay a higher premium for life insurance. It also urged companies to continue insuring individuals who contract HIV after buying the policy. This was two months after it issued draft guidelines asking insurers to provide life cover to HIV/AIDS patients.
  ,
  ,
  A lot remains to be done, especially in health insurance. At present, an individual with critical injuries or illnesses such as paralysis or cancer is more likely to getting insurance cover than an HIV positive patient on ART.

The judges had to be made to understand not only the legalities, but the nature of HIV as it was then understood.
  ,
  ,
  The case revolved around the Goa Public Health (Amendment) Act, 1985, which permitted the government to mandatorily, without consent, test a person suspected of HIV and on being so found, an individuals' confidentiality would be breached in addition to possible isolation and incarceration. This is what I called the isolationist law.
  ,
  ,
  We actually lost the case because the Goa bench of the Bombay High Court upheld the amendment except for a partial 'reading down', in that the Court allowed the person who was being tested to show by other tests that the person was indeed not ,. This had a very deleterious effect initially as we thought the isolationist law would take root in India.
  ,
  ,
  However, , and I, and other friends and comrades were able to resist the replication of the isolationist law of the Goa model in other parts of the country, which was attempted by the central government.
  ,
  ,
  In that we were able to create a certain momentum which inured to the benefit of the PLHIV movement. In fact, Dominic D'souza became the first PLHIV activist not only in India, but in the region.
  ,
  ,
  ,
  ,
  ,
  When I met Dominic in his last days in Breach Candy hospital, Mumbai, he virtually, in his usual diplomatic way, extracted a promise from me that I shall work for , as a lawyer.
  ,
  ,
  This 'tryst with Dominic' became an obsession with me from 1992-1997, which resulted in the very famous judgement of the Bombay High Court, Mx v. ZY. This landmark judgement, delivered by Justice Tipnis, for the first time provided for the recruitment of PLHIVs in the state sector. Justice Tipnis held that if the person was otherwise qualified (such as having a diploma, degree, etc), was functionally fit and he did not pose a significant risk of transmission to others in the environment, then HIV could not be the basis of any discrimination from him being recruited in the public sector.
  ,
  ,
  ,
  ,
  ,
  The success in the MX v. ZY in 1997 put Lawyers Collective's HIV work on the map such that a lot of gay people started coming to our office. On looking at the situation of gay men the conclusion was inevitable that Sextion 377 of the IPC was a cause of a lot of gay men's woes in terms of law.
  ,
  ,
  This persuaded us to mount a challenge to 377, which was ultimately done in the Delhi high court successfully in 2011, but unfortunately we faced defeat in the Supreme Court, in 2013. The curative petition is still pending in the Supreme Court.
  ,
  ,
  ,
  ,
  ,
  Indeed, Dominic D'souza's case was the first of many, which laid the roadmap of the now HIV Act. The HIV Act contains what we argued in Dominic D'souza's case in Goa, such as, no testing without informed consent (Section 5), no discrimination or isolation (Section 3) and no breach of confidentiality (Section 8).
  ,
  ,
  ,
  ,
  India has come a long way in treating PLHIV. However, there is a long way to go. We have to remember that India is the pharmacy of the developing and, partly, of the developed world. From 2000 onwards HIV ART triple combination therapy was supplied by India generic companies around the world, though this therapy ART was available from 1996 onwards in the West.
  ,
  ,
  However, we were able to supply that in India from the government sector only in 2004, despite the fact that it was Indian generic companies who were supplying ART to the rest of the developing world. Earlier, one had to reach the level of CD4 count of 350 to be on first line ART, it was then changed to 500 and now, the moment you are tested you are to be treated with ART.
  ,
  ,
  India, has now taken a policy decision to test and treat as soon as the person is detected to be HIV positive, which was recently announced by Union minister of health ,. Though this has been announced, India is still far away from the goal, we don't even comply with the CD4 500 regime till now.
  ,
  ,
  Moreover, the HIV Act, which has been recently passed in a cause for concern because under Section 14 of the HIV Act, a caveat is introduced by providing that treatment services would be provided 'as far as possible'. It appears to many, including the PLHIV community, that 'as far as possible' is an escape route for the government to evade its obligations to the community.
  ,
  ,
  Though it's a concern we still have to wait and watch whether it actually becomes a problem in the future.

  ,
  A bench of Justices Dipak Misra, A M Khanwilkar and M M Shantanagoudar, however, directed Bihar government to provide all medical facilities to her at Patna and also ordered the state to grant compensation of Rs 3 lakh to her under its scheme for rape survivors. It asked the Centre to make all arrangements to shift her to Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Science at Patna where she would be treated.
  ,
  ,
  Noting that crucial time was wasted as the woman had to fight a legal battle to seek permission to abort the fetus, it decided to frame guidelines for government authorities and courts to take a quick decision on such pleas.The court rapped the state government for opposing her plea in the Patna HC which refused to allow her to abort and it was too late by the time she approached the apex court.
  ,
  ,
  The bench said there was a fault on the part of the state government and Patna Medical College and Hospital and it was because of them that she was denied her right to undergo abortion. It agreed to hear plea to direct the state to award her compensation for negligence on its part and the hospital which insisted her to get approval of her father. The court took a strong view against the state government for opposing her plea for abortion in HC.

  PANAJI: Medical treatment cannot be denied to persons living with HIV (PLHIV) under the HIV AIDS (Prevention and Control) Act 2017 which is expected to be brought into force by the Central government shortly.
  
  ,
  The new act seeks to protect the rights of PLHIV, ensuring there is no discrimination against them in healthcare services, education, employment, public facilities, holding public office, property rights and insurance.
  ,
  ,
  Under the act, hospitals including private will not be permitted to delay surgery or charge different rates for services for PLHIV. ""This would amount to discrimination as it imposes a burden on a person based on HIV related grounds,"" senior advocate and director of the lawyers collective Anand , said.
  ,
  ,
  He was delivering a public lecture on demystifying HIV & AIDS (Prevention and Control) Bill 2017 at the International Centre, Goa organised by the Lawyers Collective and Positive People in anticipation of the latter's 25th anniversary.
  ,
  ,
  In cases of discrimination in healthcare, a PLHIV can first complain to the establishment's complaints authority to bring the problem to its notice and get it rectified, he says. If this doesn't work, a PLHIV can approach an ombudsman appointed by the state government under this act to inquire into complaints of discrimination and provision of healthcare services where he/she is expected to pass orders within 24 hours of the receipt of the complaint in medical emergency cases. A state must appoint at least one ombudsman.
  ,
  ,
  There is also no reason why insurance premium should be double for PLHIV, Grover says, pointing out that the denial or unfair treatment in providing insurance also amounts to discrimination, provided this is supported by actuarial studies.
  ,
  ,
  The act also requires that no person be compelled to disclose his HIV status except with his informed consent and if required by a court order where establishments maintaining records of HIV positive persons must adopt data protection measures.

  MUMBAI: The , (MDACS) has started a painstaking search for 8,000 HIV positive persons since the Union ministry of health issued a circular on May 5 stating that all people living with HIV (PLHIV) be started on anti retroviral therapy (ART) regardless of their blood parameters or age.
  
  ,
  The National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) previously recommended ART only for those HIV-positive people whose CD4 count (measure of a type of white blood cells) was less than 350 cell millimeter cube on two occasions three months apart.
  ,
  ,
  The new 'test and treat' policy means MDACS has to find the 8,000 people who got themselves tested at various government-run testing centres over the last few years, but were not put on ART because they didn't fulfill the previous NACO guidelines. At present, 33,000 positive people are on ART in Mumbai.

  ""We not only have to locate them, we have to get a fresh CD4 count done. Thereafter, we have to counsel them about taking ART,"" said Dr Acharya. The HIV virus remains asymptomatic for years, and it's only when the viral load increases beyond a limit that HIV-positive people start exhibiting outward symptoms such as weight loss and poor immunity against diseases.

  ""Adherence will be a big issue because why would asymptomatic HIV-positive people take strong medicines like ART,"" said infectious diseases specialist and immunologist Dr Om ,.People need to be counseled about the benefits of ART in the long run (see box).

  ""Early treatment reduces the morbidity and mortality rate significantly. Treating a patient early means we may be able to keep the person immune from TB and fungal infections. Also, the viral load becomes nearly undetectable in the blood, thus reducing the transmission to almost zero,"" said Tejashwi. He said the patient would be getting treatment even before he suffers any illness due to HIV. ""It is cost effective and suppresses the disease from spreading"" he added.

"Jul 18, 2017, 08:00 IST",Toe-reading astrologer works to make future of HIV-infected kids better,"

  Predicting the future and looking into the past by reading the lines on one's big toe may at best be called debatable. But the money an astrologer earns from this unique practice undoubtedly serves a good social cause. With the income he makes, astrologer , supports at least 30 , children in his village in , district.
  
  ,
  Astrology's purpose, according to Vijay, is to interpret the positions of the planets and stars in the sky to gather information on an individual. But in his social life, it goes beyond that.
  ,
  ,
  Vijay learnt the art after studying in detail the lines and patterns on one's big toe. For him, it all began at the age of 18. Today, he has read the lines on more than 4,500 big toes of people from different walks of life. Solutions may vary, but it's his devotion for this rare field of astrology that still brings people to his village called Avalpunthurai, 12 km from Erode.
  ,
  ,
  As a child, Vijay was different from his friends. Besides being a staunch devotee of lord Shiva, he was fond of dogs, considered the vahana (vehicle) of the lord. To express his devotion towards dogs, he even ran a shelter for dogs in his village. ""I was a devotee of , from my childhood.
  ,
  ,
  When I grew up, I used to dream of the lord. It was in one such dream that I got the idea of toe-reading,"" said Vijay, who was in Chennai recently. Vijay takes the print of one's big toe and studies the various lines on it. ""It takes four to five hours in some cases, but I could give solutions to most people who have approached me so far,"" he said.
  ,
  ,
  But learning to read the lines on one's big toe was not easy as Vijay didn't have any basic training on astrology. When he turned 18, Vijay started studying toe-prints of people and conducted research on how they are related to one's past and present.
  ,
  ,
  Vijay first started taking the toe-prints of some drunkards in his village. He then started analyzing the lines on the big toes of people who are suffering from health problems. It took a couple of years for him to understand the difference between the lines found on toes of people suffering from various issues.
  ,
  ,
  ""People in my village thought I was mad. And my strong faith in lord Shiva was another reason for them to feel so. But I didn't look back. I studied the toe-prints of more than 1,000 people during my research. It was after getting a clear understanding about the subject, I began reading the big toes of people and started giving solutions to their problems,"" said 38-year-old Vijay.
  ,
  ,
  What makes Vijay truly different, however, is the noble act that he does for the HIV-infected children in his village. ""I am not doing toe-reading for money. I am doing this under the instruction from my god. The money is used for the welfare of some 30 HIV-infected children in my village,"" he said.
  ,
  ,
  Besides, the ,, under his chairmanship, has contributed to a number of heart operations, particularly for children, conducted in and around Erode.

  HYDERABAD: Over the past few months, at least 25 , have tested positive for , with authorities raising concern over injectable drug use in the city.
  
  ,
  These are among the 12,058 new patients added to the HIV/AIDS caseload over the past 12 months.
  ,
  ,
  Drugs like heroin, cocaine, MDMA (ecstasy) - known as street-drugs are commonly injected despite the high risk of contracting AIDS. In fact, one in 23 women and one in 36 men, who inject drugs have a risk of contracting AIDS, health authorities say.
  ,
  ,
  Overall, the state has an estimated 400 such AIDS patients who contacted the dreaded virus through intravenous drug injections. Apart from the street drugs, even prescription drugs like tablets, capsules and liquids are injected occasionally, say insiders.
  ,
  ,
  ""Drug abusers often begin with taking pills or snorting drugs in the powdered form, slowly graduate to the intravenous method. Most of the abusers are obsessed with being on a perpetual high. Over time, the usage of pills, capsules, puffing and snorting slowly reduce the impact and hence they switch to intravenous drugs,"" said an official at the Narcotics Control Bureau.
  ,
  ,
  These injectable drugs are often make from powder or crystal form of drugs by dissolving them in water. Sometimes it is even heated up if required and later drawn in to the syringe by dipping a cotton ball into the solution. ""The fact that many of the drug users also have unsafe sexual practices, increase the risk of HIV due to sharing of the syringes,"" added the official.
  ,
  ,
  Apart from getting a high, there are many more reasons why addicts graduate to intravenous drugs say experts, even if it comes with the highest risk of contracting AIDS as well as other blood-related infections.
  ,
  ,
  ""The type of injected drug are opioids- the most well-known of which is heroin. Other opioid medicines that IV drugs users frequently abuse are fentanyl, Talwin and buprenorphine, as well as the prescription painkillers oxycodone and hydrocodone (the latter two are first crushed into a powder and then dissolved into a solution for injection),"" added Dr ,, senior consultant internal medicine, Maxcure hospitals.
  ,
  ,
  Stimulants are popular with IV drug users because they quickly deliver a strong feeling of euphoria, as well as increased energy, reduced appetite and a reduced need for sleep. ""People who repeatedly snort suffer discomfort due to perforation of nasal mucosa, sinusitis, nose bleeds, loss of sense of smell, problems in swallowing and hoarseness,"" he added.

"Aug 23, 2017, 07:14 IST",Most new HIV infections detected in 2016-17 were from Maharashtra,"

  Mumbai: Maharashtra detected the highest number of new , among states in 2016-17, accounting for 16% of the country's 1.84 lakh fresh cases. Among the infected were 1,567 newborns who probably didn't get the preventive drugs on time, while 200 adults got the disease due to transfusion with infected blood.
  
  ,
  This is the second year in a row when the state held on to the dubious distinction of reporting maximum cases after occupying the second and third positions through the last decade. Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka were the only states to report 20,000-plus new infections in 2016-17.
  ,
  ,
  RTI data obtained from the National Aids Control Organisation (NACO) showed while the state is recording a year-on-year decline, the rate is less than many other high-prevalence states. The state also reported the most mother-to-child transmissions in the country. In the last five years, at least 10,449 newborns got the infection despite the availability of the triple-drug regimen that cuts chances of transmission by 99%.
  ,
  ,
  Head of state-run JJ Hospital in Byculla, Dr Ashok Anand, said they have not delivered a single HIV-positive baby in the last three to four years. ""Giving anti-retroviral to babies soon after birth as well as putting the mother on anti-retroviral therapy early has proved to be very effective,"" he said. Chetan Kothari, who filed the RTI said, ""It is shameful that even today babies are getting the deadly disease when drugs are readily available.""
  ,
  ,
  Parimal Singh, who heads the , (MSACS), defended the programme and said not just mother-to-child transmission but , among general and high-risk populations has been on a decline. ""It must be taken into consideration that we came to the top spot only after Andhra Pradesh was divided. As far as babies getting HIV is concerned, today HIV+ mothers are no longer afraid of giving birth and this is the programme's achievement,"" he said. MSACS' data shows from 2009-10 when HIV positivity in general population was around 5.23%, it has dropped to less than 1% today.

  State's public health minister Dr , added Maharashtra is in a vulnerable position given the huge load of migration.

Arup Mukherjee, secretary general of the Nagpur-based Indian Red Cross Society, said a fund crunch has been hampering the project for the last two years.

  Jaipur: Those living with HIV will now have to submit their , card numbers to Rajasthan State AIDS Control Society (RSACS). The move is, however, being seen as a 'ridiculous' one by social activists as they see it as an infringement of privacy of people living with HIV.
  
  ,
  When a 45-year-old HIV patient reached Anti-Retroviral Therapy (ART) centre at Sawai Man Singh Hospital to get medicines, the healthcare staff asked her to submit Aadhaar card's photocopy. ""They asked me if I have Aadhaar card and that I should submit its photocopy,"" the patient who is taking medicine for HIV for over 10 years, said.
  ,
  ,
  The RSACS has sent messages to all its ART centres, which provide medicines to people with HIV/AIDS across the state, to collect Aadhaar from beneficiaries.
  ,
  ,
  ""Other departments are also linking social benefit schemes with Aadhaar, so we have also decided to link it. But, we have not made it compulsory for getting medicines. If a person does not have Aadhaar, he/she will continue to get medicines. We will not stop providing them medicines,"" said Dr S S Chauhan, director, RSACS.
  ,
  ,
  In the state, there are 23 ART centres that provide testing and treatment facilities to 55,000 odd people living with HIV.
  ,
  ,
  Officials said that Aadhaar will help in keeping a track on beneficiaries (people living with HIV), who go missing during treatment. Also, through Aadhaar, department will ensure that a particular beneficiary is not registered at different ART centres. They will generate a whole database online, which will have their Aadhaar number. If a person goes to an ART for HIV testing, the online software through Aadhaar will detect automatically if he is already registered at some other ART.
  ,
  ,
  Reacting on it, social activists are apprehensive that this may increase risk of revealing identity of people living with HIV/AIDS.
  ,
  ,
  ""HIV is a severe privacy issue. But it has been seen in the past that your Aadhaar is compromised at many places. There are instances of it being stolen. The question arises that how the state government will keep such database safe,"" said activist Nikhil Dey.
  ,
  ,
  Dey said, ""Once it's leaked, how they (those who get it) will use it. There is a stigma attached to HIV, so it is ridiculous to collect Aadhaar from those who are already marginalised. If they made it mandatory, there are chances of exclusion of those who do not have Aadhaar from getting benefits of government schemes.""
  ,
  ,
  Social activists termed the step as ""ridiculous"". Collecting Aadhaar from all people living with HIV/AIDS is quite challenging at a time when such people living with HIV/AIDS registered at ART do not share even their original name and address to ensure their original identity is not revealed to anyone, even at ART centres.

  It was recently found that while 489 units of blood were found to be HIV positive in 2016-17, only 230 donors were subsequently referred to the , (ICTC).
  ,
  ,
  Failure of blood banks to link HIV-infected patients with ICTC centres—where the infection is confirmed and further management of the disease facilitated— could not just lead to the individual going without antiretroviral therapy, but also infecting others inadvertently.
  ,
  ,
  At a review meeting held by the , (MDACS) in July, the findings were discussed with blood banks, who have now been asked to be more diligent in linking donors.
  ,
  ,
  HIV positivity in the city in 2016-17 was found to be 0.3%, which is lower than the national average of 0.136%. While the overall HIV positivity in blood units collected in the city has been decreasing, it seems that the infection rate at the National AIDS Control Organisation-supported blood banks has remained stagnant for the last four years. An average of 480 units of HIV-infected blood is detected every year. Interestingly, HIV positivity in non-NACO blood banks has been showing a steady decrease.

"Updated: Oct 29, 2017, 14:31 IST",Experimental vaccine may protect against HIV,"

  WASHINGTON: Scientists have developed a novel vaccine candidate that may prevent HIV infection by stimulating an immune response against sugars that form a protective shield around the virus.
  
  ,
  ""An obstacle to creating an effective HIV vaccine is the difficulty of getting the immune system to generate antibodies against the sugar shield of multiple HIV strains,"" said Lai-Xi Wang, a professor at , in the US.
  ,
  ,
  ""Our method addresses this problem by designing a vaccine component that mimics a protein-sugar part of this shield,"" said Wang.
  ,
  ,
  Researchers designed a vaccine candidate using an HIV protein fragment linked to a sugar group. When injected into rabbits, the vaccine candidate stimulated antibody responses against the sugar shield in four different HIV strains.
  ,
  ,
  The protein fragment of the vaccine candidate comes from gp120, a protein that covers HIV like a protective envelope.
  ,
  ,
  A sugar shield covers the gp120 envelope, bolstering HIV's defenses. The rare HIV-infected individuals who can keep the virus at bay without medication typically have antibodies that attack gp120.
  ,
  ,
  Researchers have tried to create an HIV vaccine targeting gp120, but had little success as the sugar shield on HIV resembles sugars found in the human body and therefore does not stimulate a strong immune response.
  ,
  ,
  More than 60 strains of HIV exist and the virus mutates frequently. As a result, antibodies against gp120 from one HIV strain will not protect against other strains.
  ,
  ,
  To overcome these challenges, researchers focused on a small fragment of gp120 protein that is common among HIV strains.
  ,
  ,
  They used a synthetic chemistry to combine the gp120 fragment with a sugar molecule, also shared among HIV strains, to mimic the sugar shield on the HIV envelope.

  Researchers then injected the protein-sugar vaccine candidate into rabbits and found that the rabbits' immune systems produced antibodies that physically bound to gp120 found in four dominant strains of HIV in circulation today.
  ,
  ,
  Injecting rabbits with a vaccine candidate that contained the protein fragment without the sugar group resulted in antibodies that primarily bound to gp120 from only one HIV strain.
  ,
  ,
  ""This result was significant because producing antibodies that directly target the defensive sugar shield is an important step in developing immunity against the target and therefore the first step in developing a truly effective vaccine,"" Wang said.
  ,
  ,
  Although the rabbits' antibodies bound to gp120, they did not prevent live HIV from infecting cells. This result did not surprise Wang, who noted that it usually takes humans up to two years to build immunity against HIV and the animal study only lasted two months.

  ,
  ""But the ability of the vaccine candidate to raise substantial antibodies against the sugar shield in only two months is encouraging,"" Wang said.

  ""Other studies took up to four years to achieve similar results. This means that our molecule is a relatively strong inducer of the immune response,"" he said.

  MUMBAI: After a blood crisis, several banks in the city have now been hit by a shortage of testing kits for HIV/AIDS. In the absence of testing kits, blood that has been collected from donors cannot be utilized for patients.

  It is feared that the existing shortage of blood in the city may be aggravated by the lack of testing kits as even if blood is collected it cannot be given to patients without certifying it as infection-free.

  ,
  ,
  Earlier, the incidence was prevalent among people in the age group of 30 to 39 years, due to the unawareness of the high risk behavior groups - Female Sex Workers (FSW), Men Sex with Men (MSM) and transgender (TG). ""HIV positive was high among the risk behavior groups, but after 2011 the trend declined and common people too have been tested positive,"" said Dr Manivannan.

  BENGALURU: A staggering 80,173 people have died of HIV over the past decade in ,, according to the death audit conducted by , (KSAPS). The state ranks eighth in the country in HIV prevalence.
  
  ,
  According to experts, the alarming number of deaths could be because of restrictions put by the government on free antiretroviral therapy (ART) for people living with the deadly disease. Of the 80,173 people who died of the disease, only 60,208 were provided antiretroviral therapy by the government, while the rest 19,965 were left out as they were not deemed eligible for the treatment.

  ,
  ,
  ,
  ""How come this data is not available on the website? Peer educators, who spread the prevention message among sex workers and play a crucial role, have not been paid honorarium for many months. Unless the state government wakes up and reaches out to the last person, its efforts to cut down on fresh HIV cases won't yield results,"" said ,, public health activist who has been working with the affected community.
  ,
  ,
  KSAPS authorities claimed that the state has taken considerable steps to reduce the number of HIV cases. ""In prevention of mother-to- child transmission, the state has taken preventive measures. Every pregnant woman is tested for HIV, and if found positive is immediately provided antiretroviral therapy. The number of children tested HIV positive at the age of 18 months was 43 in 2014-15, and has come down to 31 in 2017-18. The mother-to-child transmission rate has come down to less than 5%,"" officials said.

  LUCKNOW: Is the prevalence of HIV/AIDS in , higher than what state data shows? A study by KGMU, which puts the prevalence at 3 per 1,000 people, is higher than the data available with Uttar Pradesh State AIDS Control Society (UPSACS), which puts it at 1 per 1,000 people. The , study puts the state higher than the national average of 2.6 per 1,000 people.

  The KGMU study is based on data of regular check-up of blood donors compiled over a period of four years. KGMU is one of the few centers in India that use Nucleic Acid Test (NAT), a WHO recommended , standard for screening of blood samples and early detection of HIV, especially among infants.
  ,
  ,
  ,
  ""The usual HIV testing is done using , (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) test which is inferior to NAT. This means that several cases of HIV which may not be detected by Elisa are detected by NAT. Also, NAT can detect HIV in a person almost six months earlier than ELISA,"" said Prof ,, head of transfusion in medicine department, KGMU.

  Mysuru: 'Right to Health' is the theme for the 2017 ,, which falls on December 1. However, some people living with , in Mysuru feel stigmatized as people in the medical profession themselves are looking at them as 'aliens' by delaying treatment.
  
  ,
  Sources in Ananda Jyothi Positive Network, an organization of positive people working for the welfare of community members, claimed that doctors are avoiding treating HIV patients. They claim to have come across two cases wherein HIV patients were asked to wait for some time to get treatment after the doctors learnt they were HIV patients.
  ,
  ,
  The first patient, who had a heart ailment, was asked to come back after a few weeks. The second patient, a woman who was suffering from uterine prolapse, was told there were no beds at the hospital, they said.

  Deepa, a non-community coordinator, claimed that doctors do not deny providing treatment but delay it. ""They also ask for proof whether they had given them in writing that they wouldn't treat them. We have intervened and in talks with authorities concerned to get them treatment,"" she added.
  ,
  ,
  Treatment for co-infection like tuberculosis is easily available and it is not the case for co-morbidities like tooth ache, heart and kidney problems, claim sources. After the National Community Care Centre scheme, which reserved 10 beds for HIV patients and offered free treatment, was scrapped in 2012, treatment for HIV patients has taken a beating, sources add.
  ,
  ,
  AIDS programme Officer (in-charge) Dr C Suvarna admitted that the issue of delayed treatment was raised at a meeting but specific instances were not brought up to them. ""No one can deny treatment and in such a case one can complain to us,"" she said. The officer however claimed that for medical reasons treatment could have been delayed or postponed. ""Moreover, surgeries have to be done under extra care and it would take some time. We can analyse if the case was brought to us and whether it is 'willful' delay or not,"" she said.

"Updated: Dec 1, 2017, 13:32 IST",42% drop in new HIV positive cases in state in 7 years,"

  Nagpur: In the last seven years, the rate of new HIV-positive cases in the state has declined by about 42%. As far as mortality due to HIV is concerned, it has declined threefold in last 13 years.
  
  ,
  The facts were revealed by Dr Pramod Deoraj, an official from , (MSACS) on the occasion of World AIDS Day that falls on December 1.
  ,
  ,
  Deoraj said, ""The high rates of positive cases and deaths in the past were because earlier we had fewer ART centres, less medicine stock and not every HIV positive patient received free drugs from government due to criteria called CD4.""
  ,
  ,
  An official notification on May 5 this year made it possible to ""treat all"" living with HIV regardless of their CD4 cell count (a test that measures the strength of one's immune system). It has further contributed to decline of new cases.
  ,
  ,
  Deoraj said, ""Within the state there were about 23,000 HIV+ve patients who couldn't get the treatment because of this criteria. With the new guidelines, the government has CD4 clause and we are having a good start. In the last six months we have reached out to over 15,000 patients through ART centres and have been able to begin treatment of about 8000.""
  ,
  ,
  Deoraj said, ""In 2010, we used to record about 52,000 new HIV positive cases every year. Last year, the figure fell to 22,000. We have observed that the number is falling by about 1000 to 1200 every year. In 2004 the death rate for HIV positive patients used to be 15% and that has fallen to 5% now.""
  ,
  ,
  The state government has total 73 antiretroviral therapy (ART) centres where free drugs are given. Three centres in Nagpur district are in the medicine department of Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), at , Government Medical College and Hospital (IGMCH) and another at a public health facility in Kamptee.

  Officer of District AIDS Prevention and Control Unit (DAPCU) , said, ""In the district, we also have 21 Integrated , (ICTC) where patients are tested for HIV, counselled and connected with ARTs. In 2015, the district received a mobile van to perform as ICTC in remote areas. Last year, we received another van from the collector.""

In 2016, 378 people tested positive for HIV while 317 tested positive till October this year. , (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) cases, however, have already seen a rise during the first 10 months this year compared to last year.

  ""What should happen is that anyone who has the slightest doubt should subject themselves to testing,"" an official from the , said.

  ,
  Around 40% of HIV positive people don't know their HIV status and are hidden in the community, either due to ignorance or the stigma associated with it.
  ,
  ,
  ""Earlier people would be hesitant to get themselves tested because they thought there was no hope. Now they know there's treatment available and there's some light at the end of the tunnel,"" the official said, adding that only once the stigma goes away will more people step forward to get themselves tested.
  ,
  ,
  Thanks to the test-and-treat policy rolled out by the government in April this year, those who have tested positive for HIV can avail free antiretroviral therapy (ART). In the past, the therapy was provided only when a person's CD4 count went below normal and if it was clinically felt that his resistance had gone down.

  ""Now every person who tests positive can be put on treatment, ensuring that his viral load is kept low, thereby preventing him from contracting AIDS early on,"" he said, citing examples of people who have lived up to 25 years after being tested HIV+.

  MUMBAI: Following years of protest, the Centre is set to roll out the , for HIV/AIDS , in the next six months across the country. The test essentially tells whether the treatment regimen is working or not by measuring the amount of , virus in a patient's blood.
  
  ,
  The , (NACO) has already shortlisted laboratories across the country that would be scaled up to carry out the tests. However, it may be a while before every patient on antiretroviral therapy (ART) qualifies to undergo the expensive test, which costs between Rs 6,000 and Rs 8,000 in a private laboratory.
  ,
  ,
  In 2013, the WHO had recommended the viral load-test be carried out within six months of starting an individual on ART and be repeated at the end of that year. Subsequently, it should be carried out annually. People living with HIV and NGOs have since been fighting for the test to be made routinely available and more accessible.
  ,
  ,
  ,
  ,
  ,
  ""From February onward, 532 ART centres across the country will have the viral load-testing facility. In the initial phases, it will be offered to children below the age of five years, people taking treatment for five years and those suffering from HIV-TB co-infection. They have been chosen keeping the criticality of their condition in mind. The test will subsequently be available to all 1.2 million people on ART treatment in the country,"" said Dr R S Gupta of NACO's Care, Support and Treatment division. The civic-run KEM and Nair hospitals are likely to be the centres in the city.
  ,
  ,
  Currently, the test is selectively offered at the state-run JJ Hospital, where patients have to go through the stringent scrutiny of a committee.
  ,
  ,
  ""The body takes between four and six months only to decide who will undergo the test. It's unfortunate that in the absence of a viral load-test, the programme solely relies on CD4 count,"" said Ganesh Acharya, a member of the Mumbai Aids Forum (MAF). CD4 is an indicator of the body's immune system. ""But it's only part information about what the virus is doing with the immune system. A high viral load in the body will usually, but not always, mean a low CD4 count,"" said infectious disease expert Dr Om Srivastava, who recommends viral load-testing every six months to one year.
  ,
  ,
  ""Because of the unavailability of the test, patients also often don't realize when they have become resistant to the first line or second line drugs,"" said Poonam Patkar, secretary of MAF.
  ,
  ,
  Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) India that offers viral load-testing to KEM patients as a special model, run in collaboration with the Mumbai District Aids Control Society (MDACS), said they have got great results in picking treatment failures early and improving outcomes by addressing non-adherence in patients. The MSF data collated from KEM has shown that 90% of the patients were responding to the treatment offered under the national programme as their viral loads were suppressed.

  An infected needle turned Arun's* life upside down. In another part of the country, a blood transfusion brought Radhika's* dreams crashing down. But instead of letting their HIV+ve diagnoses fill their lives with negativity, they decided to stay positive. Brought together by a twist of fate and the late Dr Suniti Solomon, the pioneer of , research in India, the couple is now proud parents to a 16-year-old, and productive members of society.
  
  ,
  ""When I was first diagnosed with HIV, I was terrified,"" says Chennai-based Arun, who was referred to Dr Solomon of YRG CARE. ""She reassured me that I could still lead a normal life as long as I took medication, and adopted a healthy lifestyle. Getting to know other people living with HIV helped me overcome my fears,"" says Arun, who gave up smoking and drinking.
  ,
  ,
  Two years later, when Dr Solomon asked him if he was looking for a life partner, Arun was ready to take the next step forward. ""I hadn't told my parents or siblings that I am HIV+ve so they were keen to see me married. I wanted a companion but didn't want to spoil the life of another person, so I decided to marry a woman who was also HIV+ve,"" says Arun, an engineer.
  ,
  ,
  Dr Solomon, who documented the first cases of HIV in India in 1986 among sex workers, took voluntary retirement in 1993 to establish YRG Care. In the latter part of her career — as people began living longer with generic anti-retroviral medications and faced the same pressure at home to get married — she began helping healthy patients find life partners. Though the centre has played 'matchmaker' for 30 couples so far, Arun and Radhika's was the first success story.
  ,
  ,
  With Dr Solomon's encouragement, Arun decided to meet prospective brides. That's when Dr Solomon heard about Radhika, a young woman from Maharashtra. And once Arun met her and her family, he was quick to make up his mind.
  ,
  ,
  Radhika, who takes tuitions at home, was also willing to take the plunge. ""I didn't want to be alone for the rest of my life, and wanted the emotional support a partner can give,"" she says. The next hurdle was convincing his parents who were still unaware that he is HIV+ve. Arun's family was quick to come around and the only barrier was language.
  ,
  ,
  But there was another, bigger challenge ahead. The couple, who got married in July 2001, discovered that Radhika was pregnant in September. ""We were scared but both of us were on medication and our son, born in 2002, is HIV-ve,"" says Arun.
  ,
  ,
  Till today, they have not disclosed their HIV+ve identity to friends, Arun's family, or their son.
  ,
  ,
  ""There is still some stigma attached to the disease as people have misconceptions about it,"" says Radhika. ""But there is nothing to fear. We take our medicines every day, eat healthy and go to the hospital every six months to check our CD4 (white blood cell counts) and viral loads,"" says Radhika.
  ,
  ,
  Arun says getting married and having a child has given direction to his life. ""If you live on your own, you can get depressed. My outlook to life changed after marriage, and now I have a son to live and work for, which gives purpose to my life,"" he says.
  ,
  ,
  He has just one word of advice for people. ""If you are in the high-risk group, do go to the doctor and get an HIV test done. With timely and regular treatment, you can lead a normal life.""

Though 110 pregnant women were detected HIV positive in 2016-17, the number has decreased as compared to the 2015-16 figures that stood at 153 women affected with the virus.

  PANAJI: Goa has finally included children infected with or living with , as a disadvantaged section under the Right to Education (RTE) Act. This is expected to provide protection to these children from being denied admission and from being expelled from schools. In 2014, the plight of HIV-infected children in the state came to light when 13 HIV-infected orphans were expelled from a school in Rivona after parents of other students discovered their condition and demanded they not be allowed to study in the school. The students also had to change schools twice due to the objection raised by parents of other children.
  
  ,
  When a Delhi-based NGO petitioned the Supreme Court, and the apex , ruled in March this year that states include HIV-infected children in the disadvantaged group under RTE, the Goa government was forced to act on those lines. While the court had appreciated 11 states and union territories for already including HIV-infected children as a disadvantaged group, it turned out Goa was among the states that had not protected these children under the RTE Act, even though Goa notified its RTE rules seven years ago, in 2010.
  ,
  ,
  The state finally issued the notification in September this year.
  ,
  ,
  The extension of protected status to children in Goa living with or infected with HIV means that they are now entitled to special protection and measures under the terms of the RTE Act. These include eradication of discrimination, harassment, and victimisation. It will eliminate discrimination in relation to the admissions process including denying or limiting access to any benefits of enrolment or through segregation in separate study, sports, playground or canteen areas or in any other amenities provided by the school.

  ,
  The disadvantaged section will also get protection from financial extortion or forced expenditure and will be entitled to reservation of seats in private institutes.

"Updated: Dec 11, 2017, 13:19 IST",Wives at HIV risk from bisexual husbands,"

  When Savitha's* husband returned at four in the morning, the scent of a woman on him roused her suspicion. The 36-year-old mother of two dug into his bag to find a sari, a lipstick and wilted flowers. Her husband, she later found, was a bisexual cross-dresser.
  
  ,
  Four years on, Savitha remains married to the same man. Her voice — narrating her husband's affairs with other men — is among those documented by researchers who studied HIV-related risks among married , (MSM) and their ,.
  ,
  ,
  According to a 2012 study by National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO), MSM are at 12 to15 times higher risk of contracting , compared to other men. The recent study found that the HIV-related risks for the spouses of MSM were multiple, yet they are not covered under any intervention programmes of the government.
  ,
  ,
  Forty six MSMs were interviewed across five states including the cities of Chennai and Madurai. Of these, 13 , were aware of their husbands' sexual orientation. Men in these marriages were the primary decision-makers about sex and condom use.
  ,
  ,
  ""The men used condoms inconsistently with their male partners,"" said Sunil Solomon of Y R Gaitonde Centre for AIDS Research and Education, a co-author of the study. ""The women in these relationships are vulnerable but rarely feature in the country's HIV intervention programmes. The initiatives mostly address the experiences and perspectives of husbands and their male partners, but not their wives,"" said Solomon, who facilitated the interviews for two teams from , School of Medicine and Durham University.
  ,
  ,
  ,
  ,
  ,
  The few women who were interviewed said they came to know about their husbands' same-sex preference by accident. The men in the study reported having multiple male, and a few female, extramarital sexual partners.
  ,
  ,
  Forty-year-old Vasanth* from Hyderabad, who blamed his family for forcing him to marry, was among those who had not disclosed their orientation to their wives. ""If I tell my wife about my relationship with men, she may harm herself. What will happen if she tells our families? I may be making a mistake, but I cannot trouble her. So my relationship remains a secret,"" he said.
  ,
  ,
  The study pointed to the high-risk sexual behaviour among MSM and a higher prevalence of HIV among married MSM than unmarried ones. The pressure on them to conform to heteronormative masculine norms leads to hurried and unsafe sex with multiple partners.
  ,
  ,
  Many MSMs are also victims of blackmail. ""Their male partners threaten to expose them to their wives if they don't listen to their demands. In the process, they end up having sex without protection,"" said Jaya, general manager of Sahodaran, which operates a helpline for the LGBT community in Chennai.
  ,
  ,
  Some of the couples surveyed for the study had separated after the women got to know about their husbands' sexual preferences, while some remained married but no longer had a sex. However, a majority of participants continued to have sex both with their wives and partners. A few of them said they encouraged their wives to have extramarital relationships as they were not attracted to them. Women said they remain in these marriages due to cultural and economic pressures, and some for their children.
  ,
  ,
  Some women, described pressure from their husbands to have anal sex against their wishes. ""Accounts from both husbands and wives in our study indicate that husbands are the primary sexual decision-makers; some men clearly consider it a right. The men interviewed said they did not feel that using condom with their wives was ""necessary"", even when they had unsafe sex with other partners. 'I have a medical check-up every three months, so what is the need to use condom with my wife?' asked a 27-year-old bisexual man in Madurai. Condoms were only seen as a birth control measure and not to prevent sexually transmitted diseases,"" said Solomon. ""But, several participants we interviewed were actively seeking a pregnancy at the time of the interview, and consequently avoided using condoms with their wives,"" he added.
  ,
  ,
  The study said there is an urgent need for interventions to address HIV-related risk posed to wives without the unwanted disclosure of husbands' same-sex behaviour. ""For instance, engagement of these husbands in pre-exposure prophylaxis (taking HIV medicines daily to lower chances of getting infected) could reduce the men's own risk of HIV, and thereby also reduce the risk of onward transmission to their wives."" Researchers also suggested forming more support groups for these women.

  CCDT teaches families about the importance of taking antiretroviral drugs regularly and what do in case a HIV positive family member gets a cut or has an open wound. ""We give them a first aid kit and teach them to use gloves,"" says Patkar. ""If families can't afford gloves, we tell them to use plastic bags."" They also provide information about treatments.

  Jailor of Haridwar district jail, S M ,, said, ""The 21 male inmates, aged between 25 and 27, were already affected with HIV. However, they didn't know that they were carrying the virus. Seven of the 21 are, at present, out on bail and 14 others are being treated by the AIDS control society. They are all small burglars and were arrested in various cases of thefts. All are uneducated and belong to poor families.""

  Social worker Vishal Garg said, ""IV drugs are easily available at every other medical store in Haridwar. The health department is also not taking any measures to curb the use and sale of the drugs. Earlier, mostly homeless youths used IV drugs but now youngsters living in the slums have also started buying these drugs, which is a major cause of HIV spread.""

"Jan 8, 2018, 01:52 IST",HIV wanes in Maha but rages in high-risk groups,"

  MUMBAI: The recently released , Sentinel Surveillance (HSS) report has some good as well as worrying news for the state. The good news is that the deadly viral disease continues to be on a decline among general population. The worrying part: In certain pockets of the state, the disease is raging among high-risk populations like female sex workers.
  
  ,
  According to the HSS, Maharashtra is 16th in terms of HIV prevalence, a positive shift of four places since the last survey in 2014-15. From 0.29%, the prevalence has reduced to 0.26%. An official from the , (MSACS) said it was a significant drop as the HIV prevalence is now lower than the national average of 0.28%.
  ,
  ,
  But experts say it's still not time to rejoice as certain sites catering to high-risk populations such as men having sex with men (MSM), injecting drug users and female sex workers have shown a significant prevalence. Though Maharashtra is one of the states to record less than 5% HIV positivity in female sex workers, there are four sites where the prevalence has been found to be 5%. At one site, it was around 10%. Among the female sex workers in the state, the prevalence (3.48%) is more than double the national average (1.56%).
  ,
  ,
  Nagpur-based NGO Indian , (IRCS) that has been working with female sex workers said migration has emerged as a major challenge over the years. ""Commercial sex workers have started migrating and moving out of traditional pockets making it difficult to track, test or treat them. It poses a direct threat to the general population,"" said Hemlata Lohave from IRCS. She added that dwindling financial resources, too, have made their job difficult. ""Often we are working without funds for months. Even now, for instance, we haven't received money for the last quarter. We regularly lose trained workers as we can't pay salaries,"" she said.
  ,
  ,
  Among MSMs, the state is fifth on the national chart with the prevalence hovering around 4.69%, which is higher than the national average of 2.69%. However, in HSS 2014-15, the HIV prevalence among female sex workers was 7.4% and 4.9% among MSMs.

  Mumbai, too, is one of the sites with high HIV prevalence among truckers. There were nine sites with more than 1% HIV prevalence among long-distance truckers, including Mumbai with 1.2% prevalence.
  ,
  ,
  The MDACS official said the state is working on newer strategies. ""We are aware that infections are still high in metropolitan cities. In high-risk pockets, we are testing at the community level. We are also looking at multi-month dispensation of antiretroviral drugs so that a patient can come to us once in three months rather than every month,"" he said.

The , State , Control Society (TANSACS) will initiate the project on a pilot basis at the antiretroviral therapy centres in Madras Medical College and at the Institute of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Egmore, which have around 5,000 HIV-positive patients enrolled in the state programme.
  
  ,
  K Senthil Raj, TANSACS project director, said the patients will also be given a login id, so that they can access their records, including lab results and next appointment with doctors, through their phones. ""Starting from the counsellor to the staff nurse and then finally the doctor, details of the patients will be fed into the system. The doctors will have a dashboard with the patient's medical history,"" he said.
  ,
  ,
  At present, 1.2 lakh people with HIV are on the antiretroviral therapy programme run by the government.
  ,
  ,
  Officials say once a patient tests positive for HIV, the ART centre maintains a 'white card' with the patient's details, while the patient is given a notebook that carries information on their drugs intake and their CD4 count - an important indicator of the immune function and the strongest predictor of HIV progression. A doctor at an ART centre here said many of these cards are simply discarded. ""Walk into any of these centres and you will see these cards lying in some corner, gathering dust. We usually refer to the notebooks these patients bring. Mostly we go by the information they provide,"" admitted the doctor.
  ,
  ,
  The TANSACS director, too, said poor documentation was a problem. ""We also have duplication.

""We will also be able to track them better.""

Patients, who are confirmed HIV-positive, visit ART centres at least once a month for drugs and testing.
  ,
  ,
  While NGOs and experts working with people living with HIV have welcomed the move, they said digitalisation could also raise concerns on privacy.

  CHANDIGARH: The , and , high court on Monday issued notice to the Punjab government, and DGP (prisons) on a plea seeking court-monitored probe into spread of HIV virus among prisoners in Punjab jails.
  
  ,
  A division bench of the HC headed by Justice Surya Kant has issued the notice after taking cognizance of a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by , of , in , tehsil of Patiala district.
  ,
  ,
  Referring to some media reports, the petitioner has stated in the PIL that at least 1,630 inmates in nine central jails in Punjab have tested positive for HIV. Modern Jail, Fridkot, has the highest number of 439 HIV positive inmates, while , has 30, Ferozepur 322, Amritsar 299, Kapurthala 210, Ludhiana 137, Patiala 75, Hoshiarpur 63 and , 55.
  ,
  ,
  According to the petitioner, spread of HIV positive disease among jail inmates is caused due to sharing of syringes (used for taking drugs) and through sexual contact.
  ,
  ,
  The jail authorities avoid their responsibility by contending that medical examination of persons is not done before lodging them into Jails. Thus, the high incidence of HIV positive cases amongst jail inmates is taking place with connivance of jail officials, and an independent probe should be conducted by a high powered team of retired and honest police officers, advocates and retired judges, the petitioner argued. He added that such team would bring out the true reasons for spread of HIV positive cases among jail inmates. It was further argued that the measures suggested by such a team will go a long way in preventing HIV positive from spreading its wings in jails.
  ,
  ,
  The counsel also pleaded that conducting of medical examination and maintaining of records of such medical examination of persons before lodging them into jail, would prevent spread of this dreadful disease further, and conducting of periodical examination of jail inmates would help fixing responsibility of jail officials, if such a person (who did not test positive for HIV) is later found to be inflicted with the virus.

  She pointed out that the medical term for HIV-positive is ""universal precaution"", about which only a few people know. She urged the health department to promote the term so that patients are treated with dignity. Disclosure of their HIV-positive status renders patients vulnerable to harassment at the hands of chemists, who pry into their medical history and personal life.

  THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: , (KSACS) has decided to go with 4th generation , test, instead of nucleic acid-based test, to detect HIV in the window period. A study conducted by the society has found that the Elisa test was more effective than nucleic test.
  
  ,
  HIV screening had become a matter of concern following the detection of the virus in a kid, who underwent blood transfusion at Regional , Centre. Now, National AIDS Control Organisation has informed that it would supply Elisa test kits to the state.

  ""For the time being, we have supplied enough kits to all government medical college hospitals and Regional Cancer Centre. Moreover, Kerala State Medical Services Corporation (KMSCL) has also been asked to procure the kits, which will be supplied to all the blood banks and hospitals with blood banks,'' said Dr R ,, managing director of KSACS.
  ,
  ,
  As per the study, in the nucleic test the virus could not be detected even for a week after the blood is collected. ""But Elisa test gives more accurate result even during the first one week window period,'' said Dr Ramesh.
  ,
  ,
  In the past one year, KSACS collected 4 lakh blood units, of which 300 were detected with HIV using the third generation Elisa test. ""In the past four years, we might have collected about 25 lakh blood units and only in one case it has gone undetected (in the , incident). Hence our testing facilities are accurate. With this 4th generation test, we can assure 100% safety and accuracy,'' he pointed out.

  Out of the 16,578 women who donated milk to banks during 2017, the milk of at least 1.57% tested positive for HIV. Experts say this could be the tip of the iceberg as not all lactating mothers give milk to banks.
  ,
  ,
  ""The women, who donated their milk to the milk banks in 2017, were unaware that they were , or that they had Hepatitis A. They came to know about it only after they donated their milk to the bank. Before distributing milk, we have a system of testing the same,"" said Yog Guru Devendra Agarwal, state advisor of the government's Aanchal Mothers' Milk Banks.

  Rajasthan is the only state to have established 11 milk banks, with seven more in the pipeline.

"Amrita Didyala,Feb 8, 2018, 08:03 IST",Infected syringe jabs and dialysis push 100 into HIV death jaws,"

  HYDERABAD: Contaminated syringes and blood products, blood transfusion and dialysis are inflicting scores of people with the dreaded HIV as they walk out hospitals, diagnostic labs and blood banks in Telangana.
  
  ,
  State health department officials said 72 people had contracted the virus in 2017, while 100 were afflicted with it in 2016 through reuse and exposure to contaminated syringes, blood transfusion and exposure to blood products.
  ,
  ,
  ,
  ,
  ,
  ,
  ,
  An official, however, privately admitted that the figures could be much more as several patients remain unaccounted due to poor screening methods as well as HIV infection through dialysis, which is not taken into account in state figures.
  ,
  ,
  ""Patients, who undergo haemo dialysis, are highly vulnerable to hepatitis C, B and HIV, if adequate aseptic measures are not in place during dialysis. There is a high percentage of patients battling these deadly infections in the city,"" pointed out Mujtaba Hasan ,, president ,, an NGO which works with HIV patients.
  ,
  ,
  Recently, over 50 people were found to be infected with HIV in , in Uttar Pradesh due to use of unsafe medical devices. Experts say mushrooming of blood banks, improper screening of blood and lack of checks were to be blamed for the spread of HIV.
  ,
  ,
  ""The , (TSACS) data may not reflect the true picture of new cases being infected through syringes and blood transfusion. Also, the fact that blood transfusion standards are not maintained as many private blood banks have mushroomed. Absence of checks, regulations and safety protocols make matters worse,"" Askari pointed out.
  ,
  ,
  Interestingly, the latest and most-updated technology available to detect HIV, nucleic acid test (NAT), is not available in majority of the blood banks in the state.
  ,
  ,
  Currently, ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) test as well as manual screening is carried out in majority of blood banks in the state, but these test have their limitations.
  ,
  ,
  ""For ELISA test to detect HIV, the virus should have been active for at least 40 days before the test. Also, the manual testing method (for ELISA third generation) has the possibility of the virus not getting detected at all due to human error. Though NAT is the safest (can detect the virus if it has been in the body for seven days), it is a costly affair,"" T Vishnu Vardhan, chief executive officer, ,, said.
  ,
  ,
  Of 136 blood banks in the city, 43 facilities, including state-run blood banks, were being supported by , (NACO). And, less than five actually conduct NAT. NACO currently supplies the third generation manual ELISA kit to supported blood banks. ""The ELISA test is followed by almost all government as well as private sector blood banks. While one possibility is that the basic antibody test that we are doing does not detect HIV as the antibody has not yet been developed, the possibility of erroneous blood banks, negligence and a small possibility of re-use of syringes cannot be ruled out,"" Dr V Rajasekhar, project director, TSACS, said. ""So far, no incident of blood banks totally avoiding blood screening has come to our notice,"" he added.
  ,
  ,
  Also, once blood banks discover that a patient was HIV positive, they should inform, counsel and inform the TSACS and send the patient to the Integrated Counselling and Testing Centre (ICTC) in the district. ""Usually, the blood banks do not take it to the logical end when they find a patient is positive, they tend to wash their hands off,"" say insiders.

  BHOPAL: The , through used needles is a clear and present danger in ,, as nearly 50% of quacks operating in villages have , and zero awareness on the virus.
  
  ,
  Reports of a quack in Uttar Pradesh infecting 58 people with HIV by using infected needles have shaken the MP government into the need to monitor quacks, who roam around the hinterland posing as doctors. The health department issued fresh guidelines to all district chief medical and health officers (CMHO) on Wednesday to rein in these frauds.
  ,
  ,
  What adds to the worry is that Madhya Pradesh State AIDS Control Society does not list these cases in its HIV sentinel surveillance. As per MPSACS data, there are 7,021 intravenous drug users being monitored at their anti-retroviral therapy (ART) centres. Sources say 28 of them (0.4%) were infected with HIV due to the behavioural practices of addicts — sharing needles. The data does not say if the infection was attributed to quacks.
  ,
  ,
  ""We target high-risk population and the data is year-marked. Unqualified doctors will be monitored and action will be taken against them. Fresh instructions to this effect have been issued on Wednesday,"" said MPACS project direct Umesh Kumar. ""Crackdown on quacks is a law and order problem. From the standpoint of the health department, only the chief health officer can recommend action to the district administration,"" he added.
  ,
  ,
  However, the health department could not provide ready data on action initiated against quacks in 51 districts of MP. The number of HIV/AIDS patients in MP is 0.09% of the population — less than national adult prevalence of 0.27% (2013). In 2016, NACO reported 44,427 AIDS patients in MP.
  ,
  ,
  Quacks exploit the lacunae in healthcare in MP. The state has about 4,500 MBBS doctors for the health department whereas WHO estimates say there is a need for at least 15,000 more.

  BANGARMAU (,): ,, a settlement of about 5,000 people, is living under the shadow of an unknown fear. Deep Chand (name changed), ,, is an embodiment of that mortifying scare. In the past three months, 38 people from this locality of Bangarmau tehsil have been found , at screening camps in the past three months. The needle of suspicion is pointed towards a quack, ,, who has been held.
  
  ,
  Till a few months ago, Deep Chand was just like most men from Prem Ganj, working as a 'palledar' (loader) at the nearby grain market. But a few months ago, his body started saying 'no' to humongous sacks he would carry on his back to make a living. Continuous excruciating pain in the lower back took him to Yadav's , clinic in Bangarmau, the destination for many in his neighbourhood needing cheap medical help. But relief eluded him. Last month, at a camp in Prem Ganj to screen HIV cases he, along with his wife and son, tested positive. Now, he has to report to Kanpur ART Centre, 50 km away, for regular check-up and medication which is free.
  ,
  ,
  He also has four daughters. But fearing worst, he has not made them undergo the test. ""I am not fit and don't earn like before. What will happen if they, too, are tested positive? Medicine is free, but I don't have money to take six people to Kanpur. I can't even afford the cost of copies and pencils,"" he vents his angst.
  ,
  ,
  Two other nearby villages under the virus onslaught are Chakmeera and Kidmiyapur. Among the victims is a 70-year-old and also six-year-old girl. Her parents, however, are not infected. This has flummoxed local health officials.
  ,
  ,
  Rajendra Yadav, who would run his clinic from the corridor of an old Sanskrit school on the Station Road and is said to have infected many from the locality with infected syringes, was Dr 'Fixit' for the people. As per Deepu, a local youth, patients would make a beeline before his clinic before he would open it at 9am. Till the time he would call it a day around 11pm, he would have seen more than 150 patients.
  ,
  ,
  ""People from adjoining areas would also throng his dispensary. He used to charge Rs 10 for three doses of medicine and an injection shot. He would carry a 'jhola' in which he usually kept his medical kit, including used syringes, which he would wash from the hand-pump water,"" Deepu says.
  ,
  ,
  Prem Ganj came under the radar of health officials in November last when 13 people from the locality tested HIV positive at a camp held by UP State Aids Control Society. At three repeat camps in the last week of January, 25 more cases popped up. ""Nearly 270 people from Prem Ganj had got themselves examined at the camps out of which 25 tested positive.

  BENGALURU: In what could be a game changer in treating HIV patients, the , (Naco) has decided that all patients registered for anti-retroviral therapy (ART) will undergo viral load testing. It will measure the quantity of HIV virus in patients and help doctors decide their treatment regime.
  
  ,
  Hitherto, the test was conducted only after the first line of drugs failed, which would happen after 5-7 years of patients being diagnosed with HIV, and result in them losing golden time in starting new medicines.
  ,
  ,
  On Saturday, Naco instructed all state governments to get patients to undergo routine viral load tests and check mortality rate. A staggering 80,173 people have died of HIV over the past decade in Karnataka, according to the death audit conducted by Karnataka State AIDS Prevention Society (KSAPS).
  ,
  ,
  A total of 3.1 lakh people living with HIV (PLHIV) have registered for ART in the state. Across the country, an estimated 21 lakh HIV positive patients are registered with 525 ART centres. Bengaluru has seven such centres.
  ,
  ,
  While 3,16,252 people living with HIV have registered for ART treatment in Karnataka as on December 2017, only 1, 65,917 of them actively turn up for follow-ups. The rest are either dead or don't visit the centres.
  ,
  ,
  The practice till date was to get a patient, whose blood tests positive for HIV, to undergo a CD4 count before starting anti-retro viral drugs. CD4 count is a prognostic indicator where a higher number indicates a stronger immune system. Henceforth, the patient will have to undergo a viral load test too while registering for ART treatment.
  ,
  ,
  ""The cost of viral load test in the private sector ranges from Rs 4,000-6,000 and not all can afford it. The government will be spending Rs 1,200 per test,"" said an officer from KSAPS.
  ,
  ,
  This Naco move will be implemented from February 8 through , under a public-private partnership (,) project. In the first year, the agency will conduct 2.1 lakh tests. The remaining patients will be covered in a phased manner.
  ,
  ,
  ""Currently, the programme was using targeted viral load testing to confirm suspected treatment failure owing to clinical or immunological failure of the patient. From now on, patients on ART will be monitored via viral load test at regular intervals. The result will allow early detection of potential treatment failure,"" a senior officer in KSAPS said.
  ,
  ,
  Naco had also set a timeline to be followed while conducting viral load testing. ""For patients on the first line of treatment, the test should be done twice in the first year, once every six months. From the second year onwards, it should happen once a year. For second/third line patients, it must be conducted once every six months after the patient's initiation on ART,"" said KSAPS officers.
  ,
  ,
  However, NGOs closely working with people living with HIV (PHIV) in creating awareness have questioned the government's partnership with a private entity. ""There is a HIV law in place and the rules are likely to be framed by April 2018. Even before formulating the rules, why has the government tied up with a private party? Besides, if the private agency conducts tests only on 2.1 lakh of the total 21 lakh people registered for ART treatment in the country, it will cover only 10%. What about the rest? Instead, viral load tests should have been mandated for all HIV patients once every six months,"" said David Bodapatti, who has been working with PLHIV.

  MUMBAI: Transmission of HIV through infected needles doesn't seem to be restricted to villages in Uttar Pradesh alone. Patients in , too have, over the years, claimed to have contracted HIV through infected needles or syringes.
  
  ,
  An , response from , (NACO) showed that over 500 people in the state have got HIV through infected needles. Between 2012-13 and 2016-17, 512 disclosed at Integrated Centres for Testing and Counselling (ICTCs) that exposure to infected needle was responsible for the infection, said RTI activist Chetan Kothari. Numbers suggest an average 70-200 people get HIV through infected needles every year. In 2017-18, 69 people, including 29 women, contracted the infection.
  ,
  ,
  ,
  ,
  ,
  But the numbers have been highly debated by state agencies working towards controlling the disease. Parimal Sinh, who heads the state Aids control society, said less than 0.5% of new infections are due to infected needles. Over 90% of the infection in the state happens through the heterosexual route.
  ,
  ,
  ""More importantly, the needle-infection numbers are based on voluntary disclosures made by people during counselling sessions before and after they are tested for HIV in ICTCs. Often, patients tend to suggest blood transfusion and infection through needles as possible mode of transmission. While our counsellors try to find out the exact reason, we also have to keep in mind the mental state of the patient.""
  ,
  ,
  Medically too, a single needle usage may not necessarily mean transmission of HIV. Eldred Tellis of Sankalp Rehabilitation Trust, that has been working with intravenous drug users (IDUs), said the virus could survive for three hours in the bore of a needle as there is vacuum, but otherwise it would die within 10 seconds. ""But since HIV is a weak virus, the viral load of the infected person has to be really high for transmission. Studies suggest that one in 10 persons will get HIV if the needle is infected.""
  ,
  ,
  Interestingly, the highest HIV prevalence (7%) in the country is among IDUs, who use addictive substances through injections by exchanging needles. ""In most cases, they pull out blood and put it back in the syringe to extract maximum of the drug and inject into veins contributing to high HIV infection,"" he said. Tellis added that the authorities must also think of hepatitis C infection as that transmits more efficiently than HIV. ""In Mumbai IDUs, hepatitis prevalence is around 35%, whereas HIV is 9.5%,"" he said.

  ""As many 73 clinics of alleged quacks have been sealed. An FIR is being registered against three quacks while notices are being served to 44 others, who have been unable to produce degrees or relevant documents for running clinics,"" Unnao chief medical officer (CMO) Dr S P Chowdhary told TOI on Saturday.

  ,
  ,
  ""Officials have been asked to verify the credentials of the quacks who run advertisements on local TV channels in the district. The health department teams will also request cable operators to stop advertisements promoting tantriks and quacks,"" he added.
  ,

  Meanwhile, HIV affected people of the three villagers of Bangarmau — Prem Ganj, Chakmir and Kirmidiyapur — have demanded setting up of an antiretroviral therapy (ART) link centre at Bangarmau community health centre (CHC) to facilitate cheap and affordable treatment.
  ,
  ,
  At present, patients are being treated at the ART centre of Ganesh Shankar Vidyarthi Memorial (GSVM) medical college in Kanpur. ART is a therapy that improves the life quality of HIV patients with treatment that maximally suppresses the HIV virus.
  ,
  ,
  ""My 10-year-old daughter is HIV positive,"" said Vinay (name changed), describing how his entire family makes a three-hour-long journey from , where they live to the medical college in Kanpur every month.
  ,
  ,
  ""My daughter depends on antiretroviral therapy given at the ART centre to keep living. We can't afford the fare any longer. It would be better if the authorities establish a link centre at Bangarmau CHC itself,"" said Vinay.
  ,
  ,
  His views were echoed by Sudarshan (name changed), a truck driver and a father of a 12-year-old HIV positive son. Residents of Chakmir, Sudarshan and his wife travel to Kanpur every month for treatment of their son and the bus ride costs Rs 800 per trip.
  ,
  ,
  ""The amount spent on travelling to the nearest ART centre should be reimbursed. Moreover, the government should set up a link centre here, else I would have no option but to skip treatment,"" he said.
  ,
  ,
  Local social activists said what is worrying is that of the total 58 HIV positive cases identified so far during screening in the three villages, only 25 have visited the ART centre.
  ,
  ,
  ""ART treatment can't cure ,. There is still no outright cure for the disease, and it does not go away by itself. But ARTs do slow down the damage that the virus does to the immune system, and allow people to live long, productive lives like everyone else, without succumbing to the disease,"" said an activist.
  ,
  ,
  A senior health official at ART centre, meanwhile, said there were several reasons why patients avoid medication. ""They usually do not want to reveal their condition to their near and dear ones. Many skip the treatment out of the fear that others will find out about their condition,"" he said.
  ,
  ,

  However, with , featuring bottom-most in the city health department's priority list -- following a drop in prevalence over the years -- counsellors at various ICTCs complain that lab technicians in these centers are often deputed to other departments in Corporation hospitals. ""Screening is often affected in the process,"" said a counsellor. ""Patients are either asked to wait or return later, but they rarely do as most of them are part of a floating population,"" she said.
  ,
  ,
  The 42 ICTCs under corporation are managed by Chennai Corporation AIDS Prevention and Control Society (,), a body set up by National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) in the late 90s, along with similar city-wings in Mumbai and Ahmedabad. In 2016, NACO, following a decline in HIV prevalence in Ahmedabad and Chennai, wrote to the state AIDS control societies in Gujarat and Tamil Nadu asking them to merge the city-specific operations with the state.
  ,
  ,
  A senior official in TANSACS said of the Rs 69 crore the state receives every year from NACO, at least Rs 6.9 crore goes for paying salaries of around 100 CAPACS staff. ""The department is cash-strapped right now with NACO slashing funds. CAPACS is an additional burden,"" he said.

,At the age of 21 years, she and her husband had to take a tough decision to abort the child. With a mission to change peoples’ perception about HIV/AIDS, she got herself involved in social activities for HIV community. At present, she is the face of HIV community in the country. 
,
,Meet ,, who is not only president of National Coalition of People Living with HIV in India (NCPI+), but also relentlessly working for patients, most of them outcast by the society. From organizing awareness camps to marriage fairs for HIV patients and successfully running a day-boarding school and hostel for HIV-infected children, Daxa has put her life, blood and sweat for their uplift.
,
,“When my husband and I were diagnosed with HIV in 1997, there was no treatment available. Meanwhile, I got pregnant and had no choice but to go for termination. One of the doctors told me that my lifespan was just for five months. I was searching for a person infected with HIV and I found a woman who was living with the disease for two years. This gave me confidence that I could also live long. This was the turning point in my life,” says 42-year-old Daxa.
,
,Daxa, who was doing a small embroidery business from her house, and her husband informed their family and relatives about the disease. To their surprise, the family was very supportive and this further boosted her confidence on fighting discrimination faced by people like her. Her treatment began only in 2007, 10 years after he was infected.
,
,It was in 2003, Daxa, who was earlier working as a counsellor with a city-based non-governmental organization SAHAS, got in touch with Umesh Patel. Along with Umesh and other few community members, they decided to launch a platform for HIV positive people. This is how the , with HIV/ÁID (GSNP+) was launched in 2003. 
,
,The main objective of GSNP+ was to assist the people infected with HIV/AIDS, ensure they get proper medical attention and timely medicines and organizing awareness programmes etc. 
,
,“We used to meet the HIV patients at some deserted places and gardens to protect their identity. We started with just 35 members at GSNP+ and now we have 67,000 members across all the districts in Gujarat,” she said.
,
,Later, the NCPI+ was launched at the national level and the organization has a presence in 32 states across the country. Daxa is also running Janani Dham for the destitute HIV and AIDS infected orphaned children on the outskirts of the city since 2009. It is supported by Gujarat government’s social justice department and Surat-based P P Savani Group and has around 98 boys and girls. 
,
,GSNP+ will soon launch a scheme for HIV positive people, where they can get easy medicine refill and won’t have to visit government dispensaries. This is for the first time that a project has been launched with the state government and will be introduced on national-level.

"Updated: Mar 6, 2018, 04:46 IST",Help starts pouring in for HIV-positive youths,"KOLKATA: At least three house owners in the city offered to rent out portions of their houses and several others offered donation to 10 , — in pursuit of their entrepreneurial dream — on Monday, a day after TOI reported how scores of property owners refused to offer a space on rent to them to run a café once they learnt about their physical condition.

,“I have been receiving calls and emails since morning from several Good Samaritans in the city who are willing to offer space. After months of rejection, this feels like a whiff of fresh air and finally, it feels like the youths can dream big. We have lined up appointments to see the spaces over this week and hopefully, we can finalise a place by the end of this month,” said ,, the founder of Anandaghar, a shelter for the , at Narendrapur.
,
,TOI had reported on Monday that the group of 6 young boys and 4 girls have undergone training in baking, sandwich-making and coffee and mocktail-making and aspired to start their own coffee shop named ‘Café Positive’. However, months of making rounds of several properties in some of the prominent locations in south Kolkata — like Lake Road, Dover Lane, Hindusthan Park, Gol Park and Ballygunge — yielded no result. The moment the house owners came to know about the medical condition of the youths, they started distancing them from the project and refused to offer the space on rent citing “problems to be caused by the neighbourhood and family”.
,
,“Everywhere, we were turned down and at one point of time, we felt like our dream can never come true. But then, things started to change from Monday morning. Our teachers at the Home have said several people are calling us up to offer space on rent. This news itself is special for us,” said , (name changed), a Class XII student who specialises in sandwich-making and baking cookies.
,
,As per the plan, the youths want to set up a café on a 750 square feet ground floor space. The food and beverages will be served on disposable plates and there would be no sharp cutleries or glass items that can cause bleeding or cut injuries. “There will be a corner in the café where people can even make their own coffee. We will also have a space where people can make their own food items and sell it from our outlet by paying us a portion of the sales. There will also be regular gigs and space for budding musicians in the city. And of course, there will be posters and tent cards, making people aware of the disease and the myths surrounding it,” said Sanmit Das (name changed), another Class XII student.
,
,Among the many who have offered space to them is a woman from Salt Lake and two from south and north Kolkata. “The lady from Salt Lake has asked us to go immediately and see her space. Another house owner has even promised us to offer the space at a discount. But we have said that we do not want any concession,” said Ghosh.
,
,Another city-based doctor, Anindya Kar, has mentioned the youths as “young warriors” in a mail to the NGO and has offered them necessary donations to fund the project.

"Updated: Mar 5, 2018, 04:54 IST",An HIV-positive dream hits house hurdle in Kolkata,"KOLKATA: They are a bunch of 10 ordinary teenagers, who nourish the dream of making it big. But their HIV-positive status has turned them into social pariahs, with the city offering them no space to pursue their entrepreneurial dreams.

,Out to open their own café called “Cafe Positive”, all they have met with for the last three months is a big negative. No house-owner in some of south Kolkata’s posh localities has been willing to rent out space once told about “who will manage and run the shop”.
,
,While a few landlords have straightaway refused saying “e paray erom cholbena (such business won’t run in this neighbourhood)”, others have been courteous enough with financial help and old clothes, but pleaded helplessness in renting out space to the 18-plus teens.
,
,The , funding the café and trying to find a 750sqft space has approached over a dozen owners since December at locations like Golpark, Dover Lane, ,, Hindustan Park and Purna Das Road. “We have been looking for a suitable space for the café since December and approached a number of house-owners directly and through brokers. The owners initially seemed excited at the concept, but the moment they learnt that the shop will be managed and run solely by HIV-positive children, they backed out,” said ,, founder of Anandaghar, a shelter for abandoned HIV/AIDS-infected children.
,
,TOI spoke to two house-owners, one at Lake Road and the other at Dover Lane. “I would not mind renting out space to them. But we live in a joint family and some members have objections. I could not convince them, so I rejected the offer,” said a landlady.
,
,The house-owner at Dover Lane, too, blamed her neighbours and family. “I don’t know how people in our neighbourhood would react to it. I know there are many misconceptions associated with ,. I don’t think I am in a position to convince everyone. Moreover, I have now decided to rent the space to a boutique and not an eatery,” he said.
,
,The Human Immunodeficiency Virus and Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (Prevention and Control) Bill, 2017 defines what can count as discrimination against HIV-positive people. It lists that denial or discontinuation of employment, education, healthcare services, renting or residing property, standing for public or private office will count as discrimination along with unfair treatment in any of the above mentioned categories.
,
,The shelter at Narendrapur is home to around 70-odd young patients and this café project is part of an initiative to make a group self-sufficient. The NGO will give the initial funds and later hand over the management of the café to the 10 boys and girls, who would be running it.
,
,“We have been undergoing training at this shelter and can’t wait to start our café. We know the disease we suffer from and how it spreads or what precautions we need to take. But strangely, the adults don’t understand that HIV doesn’t spread through touch and often hesitate to even shake hands with us,” said , (name changed), a Class XII student who was diagnosed with HIV when he was just 5.
,
,“HIV does not spread by kissing, hugging, sharing food/drink, toilet seats, sweat, touching, sneeze/cough or through insect bites. We also want society to know about these from our café. But for that, we first need an opportunity,” said Sathi Biswas (name changed), another Class XII student who specialises in sandwich-making and baking cookies.
,
,According to the plan, food and beverages at the 750sqft ground-floor café will be served on disposable plates and there will be no sharp cutleries or glass items that can cause bleeding. “We are not looking for any exceptions or rebate and are ready to pay as per the existing market rate but even then not a single house-owner is ready,” lamented Ghosh.

"Ayesha Hassan,Mar 17, 2018, 13:07 IST",Free viral load test for HIV at three ART centres from April 19,"PATNA: Three , (ART) centres in Bihar will carry out , for HIV/AIDS from April 19. It is under the ‘Viral load testing for all people living with HIV/AIDS (PLHIV)’ initiative launched by the Union ministry of health and family welfare on February 26 this year.

,The , selected in Bihar are at , (PMCH), Nalanda Medical College and Hospital (NMCH) Patna and Sri Krishna Medical College and Hospital (SKMCH), Muzaffarpur.
,
,Total 530 ART centres have been selected for free viral load testing of 12 lakh PLHIV on treatment in the country at least once a year.
,
,The central government has tied up with a private laboratory in Mumbai under public-private partnership (PPP) mode to provide viral load testing facility to patients across the country. A senior state health department official said samples would be collected from the three ART centres and flown to the Mumbai laboratory for test. “A hard copy of the report will be sent to the state,” he said.
,
,Human immunodeficiency virus (,) targets and destroys CD4 T cells that strengthen immunity in a person. Patients with a CD4 count below 200 are susceptible to develop serious illnesses. Viral load testing essentially tells whether the ART treatment regimen is working or not by measuring the amount of virus in a patient’s blood.
,
,“In more than 95% cases, the viral load becomes undetectable after six months of ART treatment. Earlier, the only test conducted to measure the effectiveness of treatment was to check the immune level (CD4 test) in a patient. Sometimes, the patient also becomes drug-resistant after treatment and thus the viral load increases. With viral load testing in government ART centres, it will be possible to detect the increase of the viruses in the blood of the patient after treatment,” a member of International AIDS Society, Dr Diwakar Tejaswi, said.
,
,There are only three private labs in Patna for collecting samples for viral load testing and they charge approximately Rs4000- 4500 for one test.

,“HIV infection increases the risk of progression of latent TB infection to active ,, increasing the risk of death if not treated timely,” it adds.
,
,The highest prevalence of HIV among TB patients has been recorded by Nagaland (14%), followed by Andhra Pradesh (10%). One of the reasons why Karnataka is in the third position is emphasis given to the testing of HIV status of TB patients, say doctors with the state health and family welfare department.
,
,When it comes to total TB patients notified in the country, Karnataka is in the 10th position (81,187). Uttar Pradesh tops the list with 3,11,041 cases. When the prevalence of HIV among TB patients is considered, Uttar Pradesh reports only 1%, indicating poor testing.

,CHANDIGARH: At the , (ART) centre of the , (Post Graduate Institute Of Medical Education and Research) for ,, you might notice a woman in her midforties, sitting in a corner, wearing a big smile, engaging in polite conservation with the visitors, scribbling down their profile. She is Meena Vij, who lost her husband to AIDS in 2004.
,
,She was in her second pregnancy in 1994 when she learnt she was HIV +ve. She aborted the child and confronted her husband, who ran a hotel. “After initial hesitance, he accepted his relationships with multiple partners,” said Meena, whose son is 27 now, and HIV negative.
, 
, 
,There was no ‘happily ever after’ in Meena’s life with her husband, but today she helps the people living with HIV (PLHIV) in Chandigarh find love. She has married off eight of them. Her face lights up at announcing that barring one, the rest of the couples are proud parents of HIV-negative children. “Of the myths about the disease, one is that the babies born to a mother with HIV also test positive,” Meena said. “People are unaware that if the mother and her baby receive proper medication during pregnancy and after birth, the chances of it are very less.”
,
,
,
,
,Meena is a member of the Chandigarh Network of People living with HIV/AIDS, or CNP+ for short. She is also a peer counsellor of Vihaan, a CNP+ programme. Network’s president Pooja Thakur was shunned by her in-laws when she tested positive along with her two sons a decade ago. Her eldest son, however, is HIV negative. Her husband died of AIDS. Pooja dared to go public about her HIV status in order to work for HIV awareness and counselling.
,
,Her positive attitude towards life rubbed on to several women and gave them the courage to live. One of them is today a member of Chandigarh State AIDS Control Society (SACS), CNP+, and Vihaan. She joined the network in 2007 after losing her husband to AIDS. She could move to Chandigarh with her four children because of a supportive brother.
,
,Created in November 2005, CNP+ meets on the 25th of every month, for tasks such as introducing new members, following up on the missed cases, and linking the members with ART centres. Today, the network has 1,000-plus registered members, who pay an annual subscription of Rs 100.
,
,CNP+ and Vihaan participate in many programmes of the state society. “We tell the PLHIV to visit the 12 integrated counselling and testing centres (ICTCs) in Chandigarh for free testing. We ask people to practice safe sex,” said Rahul, HIV+ve for more than 10 years.
,
,
,
,
,Meena said: “More important than fighting the disease is to fight the social stigma that keeps people from sharing their HIV status with family and taking treatment. We share our life stories with these people to boost their morale. We are living examples that with proper medication and diet, one can live with this virus for years,” said Meena, HIV +ve for 24 years.
,
,The PLHIVs live as outcasts. Family and friends discriminate against them, while even doctors judge them. Pooja asked for countrywide order for the doctors and clerks to write “universal precaution” instead of “HIV positive” on their hospital cards, “so that the chemists don’t look at us differently when they see the stamp”.
,
,
,
,
,“If our identity is revealed, our children won’t get admission in schools,” said a member of the network, seeking government support for a home for HIV-positive children and a higher monthly pension for widows and children from the present Rs 1,000 and Rs 700, respectively. Ask Pooja about the free bus pass in Chandigarh for PLHIVs and she has a hearty laugh. “For seven years, no progress,” she said.

Dr Sreelatha P R, pediatrics department, , said that the girl died of leukemia. “She was admitted to the hospital on Wednesday and her condition was very serious,” the doctor said.

,The girl’s father said she was taken to the RCC after the doctors at the MCH diagnosed her with leukemia in February, 2017. The treatment for leukemia began on March 1, 2017. While she was under treatment at RCC the girl underwent blood transfusion several times. The girl was tested positive for HIV in August, 2017. “On October 5, our child was taken to a lab in Chennai for a detailed HIV test. However, the lab report said she was not HIV positive. The doctors at RCC said it was not a final report and they can confirm the presence of HIV only after getting a report from Delhi. But the doctors have not given that report us till date,” he said.
,
,The girl’s father said she was discharged from the RCC on November 1last year. “After that she was never taken to the RCC. We followed ayurveda treatment. But it did not work her. She was under the treatment of doctors at Alappuzha MCH. On Wednesday, her condition became serious and we took her to the MCH. But she died,'' he said. The funeral will be held on Thursday.

They did not advice treatment for HIV as the Chennai lab could not find viral load. We were planning to conduct a repeat HIV test on her in CMC Vellore after some months,'' he said.
,
,The Medical College police in Thiruvananthapuram in September 2017 had registered case and launched a probe after receiving a complaint from the girl's parents in this regard. The KSACS, which conducted a probe into the incident, has given a clean chit to the RCC authorities and the report of the KSACS said that the blood given to the nine-yearold girl during transfusion at RCC in Thiruvananthapuram was tested before the procedure and HIV was not detected. Report of KSACS however pointed out that RCC was not equipped to detect the virus during the window period.
